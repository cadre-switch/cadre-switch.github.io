                "abstract": "In this article, \u201cReviewing Currents,\u201d an art review by Jan Ekenberg, Ekenberg describes a variety of different technological art pieces. Ekenberg describes how the commonality of technological backgrounds in art can lead to a \u201cde-charge,\u201d in terms of experiencing each artwork individually. The author comes to this conclusion by explaining how some artworks are nicer to the viewer than the others. Some experiences are negative, some are positive; since these examples are interactive pieces. Ekenbeg then shows examples of these art pieces, such as Guy Marsden and Bruce Cannon\u2019s pieces, as well as Timothy Ryan\u2019s piece. Bruce Cannon\u2019s piece, \u201cDonation Box,\u201d is a good example of a negative, \u201cde-charged,\u201d viewer experience that Ekenberg mentions. This piece is described to accept your dollar bills, and shred it. Essentially, this creates that de-charged experience, as you don\u2019t get anything back in return, and you lose your money which is of value. Ekenberg then explains further on how artists like Steve Durie, Joe DeLappe, and Geri Wittig are using computers in order to further investigate concepts that are in no relation to the technology itself. Ekenberg describes how more artists like these will emerge to question more about art technology as a system and as a whole. ",

The data achieved through this method would also be stored into a public domain browser on the internet, free for anyone in the public to view, including larger corporations and the government. The idea behind this is the assimilation of data behind all cultures for understanding and to keep peace in the Silicon Valley. The problems discussed include morality, trading privacy for security, pervasiveness, and Big Brotherism. The article states that for this idea to work effectively, everyone affected must put trust in agencies and computers to have complete control and decide whether or not what somebody is doing in the privacy of their own home is right or wrong.",

He begins describing the web as a clumsy collection of thin content, but justifies it as it is still young and inexperienced. Emerging technologies impact our culture in ways we could not predict. An example being the web, as it was an unintentional medium of art. Squier gives examples of other artists like the Niepce brothers, Daguerre, and Edweard Muybridge and how they started off with other intentions. Artists are curious explorers and Squier believes that the web gives opportunities to leave traditional practices behind to try new methods. He mentions a couple of his own web-based works and compares them to show the way the web can offer more than just translated traditional methods. He depicts the web to be a convoluted space with immense possibilities for design and creation. Squier implores future artists to learn the language of the web tribes. A native speaker can communicate and construct something new and beyond initial intentions. Squier does not seem to have a path in mind for the tribe to take, but his tone suggests that he is interested to see where it will go.",

However, technology used to create the environment and simulation of physical objects in VR is only in the developmental stage. Laurel believes in the importance of keeping the mind grounded in the physical body, in order to strengthen the appreciation of life and nature, rather than letting the mind be disembodied and be everywhere in the virtual world.

It is a machine that allows the user to interact with microscopic particles previously only visible in 2D from an electron microscope. The second project, The Augmented Reality Project, also developed at the Chapel Hill Department of Computer Science. This device used ultrasound images to be placed over a body allowing the user to see inside of it. The final project was The Phobia Project developed by the Georgia Tech Graphics Visualization and Usability Center. This project focused on the therapeutic power of virtual reality, basically by making patients face their fears in a virtual space.",

Visions of the future are interestingly illustrated through the lens of Terry Gilliam for his unique approach to the American Western Formula. Hollywood films use specific props in order to convey different effects which suspends the viewer in believing that the movie is more than what is it. Gilliam has a different approach to the standard characters that we are used to, his main characters appear to be onlookers to the foreboding issue at play. What Gilliam achieves in his 12 Monkeys is making the viewers \u201centertain\u201d that the future of the movie may be seen as a warning.",

'Gnarly' is often used in a colloquial context, however, the author believes that the term is able to be used in an academic field as it pertains to outcomes and results of equations. Discussions towards the application of the term 'gnarly' showcase how it can be used in a scientific, mathematical, and artistic context through seemingly random patterns. In order to be gnarly, things must lie and exist between the realm of orderly and chaotic often pertaining to being unpredictable. Examples of the Mandelbrot set created by Adrien Douady and the Julia set created by Gaston Maurice Julia are used to explain how mathematical equations give a 'gnarly' result due to their recursive manner at expanding magnifications and complex dynamics. The term chaos, while having a finite definition, can have unexplainable outcomes which the author explores in terms of pseudorandom, chaotic systems, and chaotic attractors. The article also states how people can also be gnarly and how artificial life can and should be gnarly to produce unexpected and unique outcomes.",

Calife shows one-dimensional cellular automata: spaces in which virtual computers are lined up like beads on a wire, all of them computing in parallel.

The review describes in details Ann Wettrich's \"Aviary Commute\" which composition invites participants to \"turn an ordinary bus ride into an ornithological migration.\" Participants were asked to meet at the bus station and to bring a portable tape player. The second piece reviewed is Kathy Kennedy's \"The Blue Pathway\" which created a deep listening environment at the Corte Madera Town Center Mall.",

Furthermore, these installations were meant to introduce newer digital media forms into the program. The artist wanted viewers to experience a new advanced interactive experience. During the concert what was showcased was electroacoustic music as well as other live performers and \u201cautonomous agents\u201d which are robots and computers.While the concert itself was very noteworthy and a step into the future, the exhibition side of the event. During the exhibition an array of different digital media was being presented such as computer animations, videos, interactive display, computer graphics and much more.

Lange refers to Agostino Di Scipio\u2019s arguments on how technology was created by humans and therefore should be an art. More specifically, how sound can be an electronic art, especially since it can change or be manipulated just as musical artists create music. Next, she refers to Larry Wendt\u2019s article and how sound composition or poetry is structured. He goes on to explain that sound-text doesn\u2019t have a solid order and is flexible enough to be rearranged in multiple ways, so the form of art is always changing. Lastly, Lange mentions the SoundCulture events that are held in the Bay Area that features contemporary artists who work in sound as an example of what they\u2019re talking about.",

The term \u2018text-sound composition\u2019 was introduced by a collective of Swedish artists in the late 1960s known as \u2018The Language Group\u2019 of Fylkingen, a chamber music society. This article describes the birth of text-sound compositions as a result of this group of artists\u2019 experimental literary works with a tape recorder, and delves into the development of the identity of these compositions within the art world. For instance, the first International Festival of Text-Sound Composition organized by Fylkingen in 1968 is brought up, along with the adaptations and expansions made to the festival throughout the following years. Furthermore, the article also discusses the technical and formal qualities of text-sound compositions as both artworks and technological creations. The author touches on the relationship between new media and communication regarding the qualities of the narratives told as well as the connection of the medium to the passage of time. The article compares the development of different modes of communication to that of memories and myths as the details of the narratives constantly shift and change without clear boundaries between the beginning, middle, and end. \r",

The event took place in conjunction with the recent Soundculture \u201996 Festival. Lerman describes the retrospective\u2019s theme as follows: \u201cAll this work has evolved from my explorations using piezo disks to amplify small sounds.\u201d Sonoran Desert Ants (1996), Lerman\u2019s most recent video and stereo sound piece that challenges the shifting in perspective of humans, pairs the sounds of small feet and mechanically transmitted vocalizations with an equally close-up shot of the ants. The soundscapes are made up of the voices of specific and detailed components of the ambient or general surroundings. The dynamic tension between audio and visual perspectives challenges how we generally integrate the two senses into a unified worldview. Furthermore, to demonstrate how sound may elicit memories of past events, Lerman employed the vibrations of rusting barbed wire and the hanging tuning forks in his most unsettling video works, Manzanar and Dachau (1994). Through the use of pre-recorded tape delays, sounds were gradually layered. They generated a rich texture that vividly described the entire Holocaust event and resonated with the audience the unforgettable experience of history.",

With the advent of powerful computer software such as Adobe\u2019s Photoshop, artists can easily manage their work regardless of whether they want to create collages, adjust the color, add additional layers of images or text, experiment with scale, or transform dreamlike ideas into surreal artworks for public display.

Photo manipulation is regarded to be a revolutionary method of expressing emotion in all its sincerity. The emphasis is on the feeling that the digital image evokes, whether exhilarating, mesmerizing, touching, or overwhelming, eerie; not on the process by which they were created, in other words, the artist\u2019s method. Finally, the border between genuine and fake, or factual and virtual, appears to be blurring with the advancement of technology, which is considered a matter of contemporary art.",

It concludes that in order for art to gain traction with these search engines, the artist must be keenly aware of what their work is, and what they want it to represent. The author states that it is necessary for the contemporary artist to engage in critical self-reflection & analysis to determine how they wish to be seen. ",

                "abstract": "When discussing \u201cuseless\u201d web pages in regards to their existence as works of art, particularly regarding their place within an art paradigm, there are many factors to take into consideration. In this article, Benjamin Eakins states that web pages which fall under the \u201cuseless\u201d category may do so for numerous reasons such as providing meaningless data, presenting specific personal details, or offering irrelevant and insufficient information. Eakins discusses how these pages invite the viewer through the entertainment of confrontation and absurdity with the use of interactivity, randomness, and social purposes. In addition, the nature of these \u201cuseless\u201d web pages are compared to that of the Fluxus movement as well as Walter de Maria\u2019s writings. Walter de Maria asserts in his writings that \u201cmeaningless\u201d works that do not serve conventional or commercial purposes construct the most significant contemporary forms of art. Furthermore, the anti-art characteristics of Dada are discussed in relation to the anti-information qualities and properties of \u201cuseless\u201d web pages, as well as their increased separation from conventional web structure through random links that lead to unpredictable web pages. Despite the existence of these web pages within the world of art as new media artworks, Eakins highlights their lack of artistic consideration from the points of view of the creators, the viewers, and the web\u2019s search engines. Web pages exist amongst other artworks that cannot be easily contextualized in which Eakins bridges the artistic qualities of web pages to the characteristics of folk art, where the works reside past the boundaries of context and theory.",

The essay compares the idea of art as a metaphor for French politics and the \u201cuselessness\u201d of contemporary art. A sense of postmodernism is drawn from that comparison and relates to contemporary art shared on the World Wide Web. Inevitably messages and meaning found in art will change, but economics and distribution continues to ground the economy on a global scale. So contemporary art represented on the web actively dates the practice of art, and the value of the practice is predicted to change because art is an impotent cultural form living thru art institutions and administrations. The art market and artists on the world wide web will need to accommodate to the hyperreality of the internet by assigning an artificial value to their artwork. One approach towards postmodernism for artists is utilizing websites as their mediums by playing around with web formalism (deconstructing html and hypertext to achieve abstract visuals)",

The author discusses modern strategies for design and new aesthetics that re-emerged on the web. The author acknowledges that Baudrillard and Foucault overemphasize art's value as measured by the interplay of technologies of the self and production systems. He also points out that it would be as flawed a strategy to dismiss the postmodern critiques of art, as doing so runs the risk of complete cynicism and dismissal of art\u2019s value. The relationships between what the author describes as Four Technologies are discussed: The Technology of Production, Technology of Sign Systems, Technology of Power,  and the Technology of Self. The essay concludes with a discussion of a \u2018re-coding of cultural software\u2019 through many means, including traditional forms such as painting, which can become conceptually-based-productive-activities for the \u201cself\u201d once they are rethought and repurposed.

Artworks that can be viewed include Addfield by Dimos Dimmitriou, Desktop Is by Alexi Shulgin, and The Poem* Navigator by Merel Mirage. In part of the three categories participatory, information mapping, and documentational, Desktop Is is a piece that explores the computer in itself. The user interface resembles what seems to be Apple\u2019s Mac 6100. There are two folders in the middle that leads to files containing artworks. Another interesting artwork is The Institute for Media Diseases where the artist uses satire and irony to create a virtual hospital for \u201cmedia diseases.\u201d The piece features a description of the institute, including different extensions of the Institute, the research department, and the veterinary department. Other categories on the home page include case studies, health campaigns, and an electronic hospital. The case studies page features many different syndromes of the human body, shown with an art piece and description. The health campaigns page shows different diagrams of media diseases in german, english, and french versions.

The Chik Tek symposium took place in November 1997 at the San Jose Museum of Art where many women would share their works and thoughts through presentations and discussions. The title of the show, Chik Tek seemed questionable due to the fact that this show was meant to discuss women, and the equality in their work and the art or tech field. Yet, the title was rather stereotypical for women who wanted to encourage empowerment and feminism. Each artist, Lisa Milosevich, Tamiko Thiel, Geri Wittig, Lynn Hershman, Lisa Jevbratt, Diane Fenster, Monica Lam, and E.G. Crichton were each interviewed, and asked to talk about a mixed gender conference, the separation of gender in the art field, and what the term \u201cchick\u201d means to them. Wood summarizes each of their conversations, and each starts out with talking about previous experiences in the art fields and how they got to where they currently are. Additionally, many of them go over why it\u2019s important to talk about subjects like the gender separation and feminism, as well as why it\u2019s necessary to have a symposium dedicated to women only.\r\n",

Guillemot also mentioned CD-ROM and the web at the time when DOTCOM started to boom, the years 1998 - 2000. He uses the web to create synthetic artworks and talks about how artworks cannot be objective, the same way scientists such as archeologists are not really objective. In his responses to Switch Staff, Guillemot explains scientists and artists do not form a bias in their works and do not favor one side or another. By creating Art of False, it can be seen as false art, and will take time for these images to be recognized for what it is for.",

Practical implementation of organizations will tend to have elements of both centralized and distributed structures. Additionally, it is beneficial to mainstream organizations to incorporate or recuperate activist or grassroots distributed elements in order to bring in new energies, thoughts, and ideas. The discussion then shifts to drugs and information control. Plant argues that drugs and information have similar characteristics in that both have the ability to change perception and thoughts. The tools that governments use to control and monitor drugs can also be applied to information. There is danger when centralized organizations are in conflict, like Microsoft versus the government, or drug cartels fighting drug enforcement agencies. Lastly, the interview talks about how cyberspace and technology bring changes to the thoughts and ideas of the mind and body. New advances in science suggest the possibility of blurring the boundary of a natural body and digital body while also connecting minds and networks together to create a new kind of body.",

Due to rapid increase in quick interactions through the web, people that converse through actions quickly cannot go back and undo their problems. There are more people in one country of Europe that pays more attention to the arts than the entire country of the United States. The reason why Sandy Stone is more fascinated by Europe than America is because Europe is more conservative in both art and technology, whereas America is more liberal into the fields. Modern technology continues to become more sophisticated, so the hackers abuse it, making them difficult to track.. Consequently, someone will always come out with a more complex piece of technology, overcoming what\u2019s currently available.",

                "abstract": "The article reveals how control can mitigate the boredom in traditional linear media consumed in days' past, how new interactive media can grant children more agency, and in turn make them feel more empowered. It then goes on to discuss how kids' media culture, specifically the trope of \"instantaneous physical transformation,'' encourages viewers to have fluid identities and asks if this power can provide a platform for social change. With the help of \"The Changelings Project,\"a research initiative at the Annenberg Center for Communication at the University of Southern California, Kinder was able to combine these two ideas of agency and fluid identities in the game \"Runaways.\" In the game players must solve a missing person's case centered on 16-year old Latina Rita Rodriguez, once this case is solved other cases concerning ethnic communties are opened, in addition players are able to customize race, ethnicity, gender, sex, and sexuality, which in turn affect the narrative of the game. These choices are given to players in order to make them ponder the complexity of the choices to challenge social norms. Mark Jonathan Harris, Kristy H. Kang, Patty Podesta, William S. Hughes helped to create the game, also working as searchers in the game along with production students to reflect diversity of the crew on-screen. The article then goes on to criticize gender norms in society, noting how many games such as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles target boys, while Barbies are seen as 'girls' toys'. Going on to explain how games can provide a bridge between social conventions and respond to individuals playing them, and noting how her own game seeks to have as few rules as possible to give the most agency. To increase emotional engagement, the game is centered on the issue of teenage runaways as race, ethnicity, gender, sex, and sexuality are predominantly linked to real life cases. Players ID cards are tied to the game, affecting choices in order to acknowledge and not disclude any particular marginalized group. The game seeks to not paint situations as black and white, revealing how running away is not wholly dependent on the child or the parent, and sometimes even both can be at fault. \"Runaways\" is a double entendre, critiquing how many games are created for boys, but also noting how games created by Mattel, Purple Moon, and Games for Girls do the opposite. In this case \"Runaways\" is an alternative, allowing for cross gender play. Overall, the game is a vicarious experience for potential runaways to show the potential dangers of doing so, and bring attention to a very real social problem.",

This exhibit focuses on 14 game patches and their representation as a reactionary collection of cultural and literal hacks that provide an intersection between hacker, artist, gamer, and cultural. The game patches also explore contemporary user interface and spatial semiotics, of narratives and environments, of identity and gender configurations presented within a game character, and of interactivity pertaining to gaming modes.",

The article traces the rise of the gaming industry from a niche to a major sector of commercial media, juxtaposed against the traditional media forms like cinema and television. It argues that while gaming has transformed into a big business, it retains elements of its roots as \"a people's technology.\" This transformation has spurred some within the gaming community to use patches and plug-ins creatively to reclaim or alter the gaming experience, pushing back against its commercial constraints. The text positions game patches as a form of \"tactical media,\" akin to historical artistic movements that sought to subvert mainstream media narratives. This parallels with other forms of media resistance like scratch video, highlighting both the possibilities and limitations of such endeavors in challenging or changing the dominant media culture. The game patch phenomenon is portrayed not just as nostalgia for the medium's freer past but as a dynamic interface for personal expression and cultural critique in the digital age.",

In addition, she believes that it is for women because they do not receive the same equality as men. Basically, the whole theme for the site is equality between men and women who share a common interest in video games. The whole purpose of GameGirlz.com is to make men and women feel safe when sharing their interests and thoughts of video games without feeling hostile from the people in a toxic environment. In addition, they want a site where people do not feel like they do not have to scroll through the website and see semi-nude pictures. Another information that was brought up was when women developers would ask a question such as what kind of game do people want to see.

Manovich first introduces Sigmund Feud in the year 1928, where Freud met with the Russian designer El Lissitzky to talk about psychoanalysis and modern architecture. During their discussion, they created the Interpretation of Dreams, Freud\u2019s model of the concious/unconciousness. Around this time, Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein wanted to create a film adaptation of Marx\u2019s Capital, which later became his idea of \u201cdisplacing\u201d Capital in the Interpretation of Dreams. Essentially, Freud and Lissitzky was convinced to commission Eisenstein to creat a walkthrough of the model of a house. While visiting Bauhaus around the year 1929, he talks to Hungarian artist and Bauhaus professor Moholy-Nagy to see if his students could make a model of the house that Eisenstein could film. Eisenstein also meets young American engineer Edwin Link who talks about his first flight simulator, which has a simulation of the cockpits and controls. Except, there are no visuals in Link\u2019s simulation. However, even though Eisenstein was able to get to America and connect with Disney through Link\u2019s connections, he was unable to realize his dream of the Freud-Lissitzky navigator.\r\n\r\nAfter the first computer game Spacewar was written by MIT Steve Russel in 1961 and many other accomplishments, the Freud-Lissitzky Navigator became a tool than many used for their own projects. Currently, the Freud-Lissitzky Navigator is being reconstructed from an early version by many different individuals and groups.",

In the article, the author makes the claim that databases are central to many fields of contemporary research. In Database and Culture, the author discusses Lev Manovich\u2019s article \"Database as a Symbolic Form.\" Media, Storage, Cadaver discusses \"Gramophone, Film, Typewriter\" by Friedrich Kittler. In the next mini chapter, diversity.com/population.gov, the author discusses biological databases in more detail and questions whether they constitute a new ordering of knowledge. The author discusses the Human Genome Project as a primary example of a new paradigm for the role of databases in scientific research. In the next chapter, Biopolitics, the author suggests a way to approach the questions posed by databases using concepts of \"governmentality\" and \"biopolitics\" from Michel Foucault's later work. The author concludes the article by discussing connections between the Human Genome Project and concepts from Manovich, Kettler, and Foucault.",

The narrative highlights the pivotal role of VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet application, in democratizing data manipulation and marking a significant shift from traditional data processing to user-driven database interaction. This shift enabled individuals and organizations to manage and analyze data independently, fostering the personal computer revolution. The evolution continued with the development of hypertext, which enhanced textual data's interactivity and laid the groundwork for the World Wide Web, transforming how information is organized and accessed globally. The article discusses how these innovations have led to new forms of databases, including multimedia databases, and ponders future developments in this field, emphasizing the ongoing significance of databases in shaping technological and social landscapes.",

Advancing the concept of new media changing the nature of the relationship between producers and users of cultural objects by creating a larger overlap between them, the interview leads into a detailed dissection of Manovich\u2019s thoughts concerning both the complexities and the moral implications of this shift from old media to new media. Additionally, referencing some of his previously written articles involving Russian media culture and arts, Manovich provides general critical insights regarding the concept of culturally-specific \u201cnetart\u201d and further inquires about the accuracy of the term, itself. \r\n",

Galloway (Ph.D., The Literature Program, Duke University, 2001 and B.A., Modern Culture and Media, Brown University, 1996), major events pertaining to net art in 1999 was explored. Specifically, Galloway explored how net art was evolving. Many people are bored of emails and simplicity in function and instead want new interfaces and creativity, both as an artform and as a software. To many prominent figures in net art, the aesthetics and elegnace play a big part in the digital realm. For example, Communimage is a digital mosaic composed of images that cant be fitted with the audience, specifically by matching users automatically with their \u201cpicture neighbors\u201d by email. This type of archived data becoming art began to grow during the year 1999. Another important part of 1999 was how the offline world was reshaped. Nettime, an email list, had suddenly become web-specific and public, losing the \u201coffline\u201d charm it hard. 1999\u2019s Net_condition exhibition at the Center for Art and Media Technology (ZKM) was very important for the offline net art world. It became an introduction and tutorial to net art. In addition, Hell.com, a training ground for net art, claimed to not do art or net art, even though they created an artistic pantheon. ",

These projects serve as platforms for introspection, social commentary, and public engagement. The artist reflects on the importance of process over results in art, emphasizing how the interactions and experiences during the project shape both the work and the artist's personal growth.

The keynote speaker was professor Pierre Levy, and each panel is broken down into its essential thesis and themes, and then sorted and compared to the traditional seven deadly sins from the Bible. These sins are used as categorical definers for different problems that accompany present-day new media art. In order: Pride, Greed, Sloth, Anger/Gluttony, Envy, and Lust are broken into 6 different sections each taking a look at different trends in new media art. In summation, Pride, Envy, and Anger focus on issues pertaining to the perversion and corruption of art and media; Greed, Gluttony, and Lust focus on the problems that arise out of excessive media; and Sloth focuses on troubles born out of insufficient media. The topics covered within each sin primarily encompass the narrow-sightedness of new media artists, the lack of innovation inspired by new media, and the barriers both real and imaginary that artists begin to feel between them and the creation of their art in this new media age. All subjects brought up in the various panels are compared and contrasted in ways that highlight both the problems and solutions that have emerged in the past few decades for new media artists.",

It covers the beginning steps of art going online; from early forums to widespread reception. During this era, digital/online based art and artists were often looked down upon or belittled. Net art did not fit traditional art theory, and the wider public saw basic web design as the peak of the medium\u2019s potential. Josephine Bosma dispels net art myths, and provides history and explanations of art\u2019s early steps into the net with great detail. Bosma closes off the article with words of advice and suggestions for the growth of the art practice.",

During this conference, she met and spoke with several of its artists, exhibitors, curators, and attendees and discussed their ideas and perspectives of the event and VRML, including Professor Kathy Rae Huffman, Melentie Pandilovski, and Nicole Stenger. Huffman, who studies Electronic Media Arts and Communication, greeted the author and explained virtual environments' capabilities and benefits. Pandilovski, the director of the Center for Contemporary Arts in Skopje, Macedonia, showed interest in the philosophical implications of VR and raised questions about the evolution and structure of the human mind. Finally, Stenger, an artist, and pioneer in VR, demonstrated her project inspired by American cities and based on handmade books and manuscripts.

The article discusses Sandy Stone's work, particularly in the context of performance and art, as well as the intersection of technology and human experience. Sandy Stone touches on the apparent reality of technology and how it is an endless source of information, and compares it to a modern education. Stone says that universities now only provide credentials rather than a sufficient education. Stone touches on the act of online performances and its ability to reach a wider audience while also giving the audience an opportunity to participate in the piece or even control the narrative. An online presence also brings up the idea of online anonymity, a person can take on any motif or image that perfectly describes them; they are able to exist within different realms simultaneously without any of the real world repercussions.

As the digital age ushers in new methods of music production and distribution, artists increasingly rely on platforms like MP3s, Napster, and Rocket Networks to collaborate across vast distances. The piece features insights from several musicians who utilize these technologies to various effects, highlighting the mixed responses regarding the advantages of digital collaboration tools versus the traditional, synchronous creation processes. Key examples include Tom Aragon, who leverages MP3 technology to create diverse music catalogs with global collaborators, and Rob Johnson of Protolab, who finds MP3s instrumental for sharing ideas within his band. Conversely, artists like Kevin Dooley express concerns about sound fidelity with digital formats, and Mark from Negativland voices a preference for in-person interactions. This exploration into digital music collaboration underscores the complexities and dualities of integrating technology with artistic creation, emphasizing that while new tools offer expansive opportunities, they also present unique challenges and do not necessarily replace the need for traditional, in-person collaborations.",

The book Robot in the Garden is a collective transcription of telerobotic research and documentation. In the article, Ahuna dissects Robot in the Garden as a breakdown of telerobotic and its relationship with the internet, epistemology, and subcategories of technology based around the internet. The book illustrates critical points of reference regarding telerobotic \u201c case studies in progress; theoretical beliefs; telerobotic scenarios; arguments and parallels of epistemology; questions and approaches to mediation; differences between using the Internet and other acknowledge-based mediums\u201d. The installation of the Robot in the Garden is one that gives multi-users the ability to grow their own flowers or vegetables and allows visitors to communicate with other users. Throughout the review of the book, Ahuna focuses on examples of experimentation of robots using human qualities, such as trust and touch. Also, social networking between robots and humans like the robot phenomenon Julia, while demonstrating the use of telepresence. All of the studies focused on the article and book developed from live interaction in remote worlds.\n",

DIGITAL ST JOHN is described as a multi-layered, interactive virtual world based on the ancient cosmological concept of a seven-tiered universe. The discussion also touches on practical challenges, such as securing sufficient resources and funding for such an ambitious project, with support from Ground Zero\u2014a partner helping to bring the virtual project to fruition.

Several propositions are discussed including fuzziness, conscious Ideation, knowledge networks, idea structures, and idea coercion.  It is theorized that ideas makeup our consciousness and provide a more open definition to the experiences that combine the cognitive process. However, the fuzziness of uncertainty also raises ideas of its essential factor in our conscious exploration and that fuzziness of knowledge does not make knowledge obsolete. This posits that there is no absolute or universal truth, but rather perceptions of concepts that we make sense of to guide our idea structure. Although consciousness acts as its own entity, it isn\u2019t to be separated from body or mind as the emotions of the human experience can coerce the cybernetics of consciousness. To handle the dilemmas of knowledge networks, the author suggests the arts to act as records of idea structures and provide a visual representation of the mapping of the consciousness-net. \n",

The article was then emailed to the editors from the Cyberia web cafe in Bangalore. The author uses three countries, UK/USA/India, to compare the use of new media and the fact that they share divisions within their basic socio-economic structures which leads to similar access to ideas and facilities. However the author acknowledges that artists in India will generally know more about artists working in the West than the West would know about artists based in India. For example, Graham discusses the work of Indian artist Vivan Sundaram who has been making video installations and site specific work for many years but is not as well recognized in the US. The article discusses educational, social and commercial ventures which symbolizes the differences in cultures by media and personal diaspora. For example, the Indian Directory of Electronic Art CD-ROM magazine was produced in Delhi with limited resources, but was able to be circulated worldwide through the Media Art Industry.     \r\n",

As seen that both situated and distributed knowledge production exists within the same organization network. If the constructed operational subject can go through effective actions to further situate the knowledge production and consensual domains that were created through both situated distributed knowledge bases.\r",

The article discusses how software is shaped by data relations and how it operates within a consensual domain of interactions. The article delves into the idea that software is not fixed but scales in a fluid transition across technical, semantic, and behavioral trajectories. It also examines the notion of software as both in and of the environment, emphasizing its social nature. The article touches on concepts like scaled states, interiority/exteriority, and cross-domain inferencing to better understand the social behavior and ontogeny of software. Ultimately, it raises questions about the evolving dynamics of software relationships and the potential for new technology paradigms.",

Because these laws, posed as questions, are applicable to all artistic mediums, Berland utilizes this guide to expand upon the Music(king) Machine. She breaks down that collaborators, audience, performance, ears, instruments, and skills are elements that are not necessarily needed in today\u2019s music, unlike in the prior music production done by human musicians. Berland refers to specific examples of digital technologies within music, like sampling, editing tools, and simulations, among many others, elaborating on how they are contributing to the obsolescence of musicians.",

Similar to the real life, but when communities form through an online game platform, a semantic world of sharing knowledge, solving problems, working as a team, playing, building, quarreling, cooperating, planning and forming relationships develop. Games are formal because they have a set of rules. A game is a system because it has a collection of parts that interact with each other in complex ways. Because game communities are social in nature, knowledge and understanding are more apparent in virtual worlds and it is great to connect these two thoughts.",

Spanning from traditional media to performance art and from feminist activism to electronic culture, the artist reflects on her varied experiences across different facets of the art scene. She highlights the fragmented nature of the art economy and stresses the importance of adaptability and tactical innovation for oppositional cultural producers. The artist also critiques the conventional art institutional system that emphasizes spectacles and hierarchical structures, advocating instead for a more flexible and collaborative approach that empowers the so-called \"bottom feeders\" of the art world. Furthermore, she discusses the shifting trends within the art world, including the recent embrace of electronic and network art by mainstream institutions, and reflects on her current involvement with the collective practice of SubRosa, a cyberfeminist organization she co-led with fellow artist Hyla Willis, which focuses on interdisciplinary and activist work in electronic culture. In their presentation of the BioTech Sex and Gender Education Show, SubRosa facilitated a genetically sound and professionally approved union between the author's genetic materials and those of Joel Slayton (founder of the CADRE lab at SJSU, archived herehttp://cyberfeminism.net/sex-and-gender-ed-show/).

Paul discusses collaborative curation that enables multiple curators sharing equal amounts of responsibilities and work. She goes on to state that curation of new media requires constant dialogue between the curators and artists, as well as a shared decision-making process when it comes to the presentation of the work. She discusses some Media Artists who become producers that work with a whole team of collaborators; in most of these cases the collaborators are very much involved in aesthetic decisions. The article concludes with a discussion of emerging trends in new media including hacktivism and the use of mobile technologies.",

She describes the evolution of her work from interactive sculpture and video installation to research that re-imagines networked environments as spaces for public, community, and collaborative engagement. These systems allow individuals to share their stories, contributing to a growing public archive. As an Assistant Professor at UCSC, Daniel teaches digital media theory and practice. Her interest lies in the collaborative process in art and education, and she focuses on programs aiding marginalized communities. In the interview she discusses her approach to art, rejecting traditional models of individual subjectivity and hierarchy in favor of systems thinking, which emphasizes community, inter-subjectivity, and the blending of individual and collective narratives. She describes her work as \"context-provision\" and explores concepts like the \"subject_system,\" where individual identity is seen as part of a larger, fluid network. Daniel also discusses her community projects, like working with Casa Segura, an HIV prevention clinic, emphasizing the importance of self-representation and communication in fostering social change.",

Pask being an expert in the fields of cybernetics and psychology and Pangaro learned computer science and humanities while studying at MIT. The artwork utilizes a framework for a machine conversational and learning system called DoWhatDo developed by the artists at MIT. Slayton argues that the project can be considered both an art piece and a social software that blurs boundaries between structure and process. The concept of the work focuses on both the theoretical discourse of databases and knowledge engineering. The article discusses the development of the project, the technology it uses, and two conceptual frameworks for understanding the project in a larger context; \u2018Conceptualization of Entailment\u2019 & the \u2018Necessity of Inferencing\u2019.",

There is an emphasis in both collaboration\u2019s opposition to traditional hierarchies and repressive methods as well as its results: cultural sensibilities, models, and an open forum for diverse opinions that contribute social, economic, and political results. While corporations, businesses, and bureaucratic administrations have typically used conceptual and traditional models of collaboration, creatives are now using these same models. In return, said creatives are holding discourses, conversations, and critical analyses regarding the breakage from these traditional hierarchies and constraining methods.\n",

As the web is increasingly integrated into artistic creation, the launching of exhibitions and the building of archives has become a creative practice. A case in point was the 2001 biennial, \"Beau Monde: Towards a Redeed Cosmopolitanism,\" curated by Dave Hickey. It links the curator's name to the exhibition, so that the curators can be as prestigious as the artists they exhibit. Another example is Rhizome ArtBase, a new media art platform developed for Rhizome's net art community. Which encourages artists to invent new strategies for bridging, nullifying the divide between art, programming, and practice. Today, publicly accessible, searchable databases and \"digital\" art exhibitions have transformed the way archives are conceived, managed and operated.",

The project describes how data travels through various network components and is affected by several nodes as it travels from sender to receiver. The technical description of the project and how it operates is included. It is clarified that the software is written in C, operates as a multithreaded server/client on each node, and uses an OpenGL graphic engine for visual output. The project description is concluded by stating a universal takeaway that the source of data is flexible, reflecting the ever evolving nature of data in networked systems. ",

Oliver Grau discussed the basic functions of images and the impact of new media on the development of images from the perspective of virtual and real. He states that the network and computer have played a great role in the development of art, but he believes that art history is still the core pillar of art development. He goes on to describe new media as a tool that provides support and assistance for art research. He discusses the immersive experience created by the fusion of images and equipment. He warns that reflective thinking of the mind could destroy the aesthetic experience, and suggests that increasing emotional participation will provide a better immersive experience. Humans are always craving novel illusions, and with the development of technology and people's fascination with the virtual world. He argues that the establishment of reflective criticism in virtual world relationships will emerge in the future. The interview concludes with a discussion of the ways image media will continue to change in the future and eventually develop into a combination of images and hallucinations that we cannot perceive.",

The author discusses the work\u2019s significance; Leeson\u2019s contribution to Feminist art theories and its movement that has transformed the expectations and established interfaces of the art world. Within her practice, she explores the surfaces between art and reality; role projection and identity in the 70s, boundaries between human and cyborg in the 80s, polarities of perspectives in the 90s, and the idea of agency and progeny in the new millennium. The article concludes with an overview of Lynn Hershman Leeson\u2019s contributions to new media that continues to slip between interfaces and break boundaries; both in her art as well as in her activism to demand social justice for inequities in society.",

Specifics about the  project at the Canada Research Chair in Collective Intelligence at the University of Ottawa are detailed. The project aims to create a new research field which studies the \"cognitive power\" of groups. \"Cognitive power\" is defined as a power that utilized new communication techniques for intellectual collaboration as well as the intentional improvement of cultural and social factors. In Theoretical Research the author defines factors which he aims to use to define collective intelligence. The software, \"The collective Intelligence Game,\" is used for collaboration, institutional representation, data visualizations, and as a learning game. The next section details the other aims of the author's research, unrelated to developing his theoretical model and software. The article closes with a description of how research will proceed in the following years.",

Curated by James Morgan, Matt Haberman, and Michael Brown, and in collaboration with Phantom Galleries, Anno Domini, and CADRE Laboratory for New Media, this project spanned April to May 2004. The exhibition utilized a network of visual and interactive technologies to bridge the gap between private and public spaces, turning inactive commercial fronts into zones of vibrant, public engagement. This included streaming cameras, data interfaces, and several artist-specific installations, such as \"Meta Project\" and \"52 Samples,\" which manipulated viewer interaction and surveillance dynamics. The exhibition aimed not only to revitalize a derelict space but also to test the boundaries of interaction within an urban environment, prompting visitors to reconsider the roles of observer and participant. The success of the exhibition was noted by the perception of revitalization in the area and the documented engagement of passersby.",

The discussion touches on the role of immigration, isolation, and the Pacific Rim in shaping Perth's bio-art scene which produced initiatives like SymbioticA, Tissue Culture & Art, and Clinical Cell Culture, highlighting the city's history as a community built on immigration and its openness to new ideas. The article concludes by attributing the growth of bio-art in Perth to the region's extreme landscape, collaborative spirit, and the unique challenges that foster a desire to connect with the wider world.",

                "abstract": "After a brief hiatus, the new issue of Switch has emerged. After 2 solid years of work leading up to ISEA2006 and the ZeroOne Festival, CADRE and SWITCH have been considering new agendas, strategies and opportunities. Over the last several months, the CADRE Laboratory has engaged in a diverse set of activities. We have explored issues such as failure (its lessons and its utility), borders (real/virtual, body/technology, open/closed), and in what direction \"new\" media may be going. Issue 23 highlights the diversity of these activities, which we have grouped under the rubric of \"Function / Border / Dysfunction\". Among other things, we have interviews with Michael Joaquin Grey, Saskia Sassen and Lu Jie. Cultural theorist/art historian Dore Bowen explores \"The Function of Dysfunction\" in her article on Fluxus event scores. The CADRE Lab introduces its Speaker Salon Series, it's new artist residency with the Montalvo Arts Center and it's collaboration with Ars Virtua in sponsoring the Borders conference in Second Life.",

The newly formed FUSE initiative brings together international artist with Silicon Valley industry, academia and the cultural sector and is being developed in cooperation with the prestigious Montalvo Arts Center and ZER01. Outcomes of the residency will be featured at 01SJ biennial festival June 4-8, 2008.\n\nThe artists included Graffiti Research Lab, Red76, Natalie Jereminjeniko, Mongrel, Center for Land Use Interpretation, Kevin and Jennifer McCoy and Eddo Stern. Each presented a public lecture at the new San Jose City Hall designed by international renown architect Richard Meyer, conducted student workshops and met with community leaders examine potential residency topics. Through FUSE and CADRE the artist brought to the surface new conceptual approaches represented through important experiment, discussion and principle. These artists are featured in this issue of SWITCH with the general theme of Re-Purpose.",

Artists are also borrowers of technology, revisiting its purpose to enhance, question, conceptualize and transform. This issue of SWITCH is about opening the discussion of using this planet as we connect it to technology. This issue is \"Greenish\". The CADRE New Media lab opened this issue to contributors whose eclectic backgrounds compliment and even conflict with each other as they visit issues of sustainability, green technology and personal responsibility. This issue also parallels the San Jose ZER01 festival, June 4-8, by tying in the FUSE residencies with festival events.",
