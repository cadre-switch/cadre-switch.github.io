      <p>
        <b>Alexander Price  0:00</b> <br> Okay, thank you, Mr. Ardron, for coming. By the way, I really appreciate that.

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Mitra Ardron  0:03</b> <br> So I'm Mitra Ardron. And being involved in was involved in the internet in the early days around both the early days of the net, and VRML. These days, I mostly mentor people working with innovation and technology to solve big problems like the STGs and climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Alexander Price  0:28  </b> <br>That's great. What is the earliest memory you have of developing technology?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Mitra Ardron  0:33
</b> <br>So my earliest memory would have been back in like 85, I started an internet provider. And so this has been before there was an ad in the email. And so I was jumping on creating a internet provider that was used mostly by the nonprofit sector. Where did that end up going after that? Well, the the ISP is still around, it's an England called Green net. And we created an international organization called the APC, which is now the, what we call in Australia, the peak body. So it's a body whose members are themselves organizations that works on digital human rights, mostly in the developing world.


      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Alexander Price  1:11
</b> <br>So what is your experience working with web 3D? Or what's commonly referred to as the metaverse these days? What is your total experience with that?

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Mitra Ardron  1:19  </b> <br>
        Yeah, so I got involved in it back in who must be about like, 1985-ish, 84-ish, when I was brought on by Worlds Inc, to create the technology behind the first shared 3d environment on the net. So So before that time, there were things like Doom, which were multiplayer games, 2.5D. And it was very easy to do that, because you have very little data to transmit, everything was previously downloaded to people's computers. And the only content was, it was a one bit content, as we said, live or dead, you met people to shoot them. And the world wanted to create 3D environments where people could interact with each other. And so we created worlds chat, that was a 3D space station. And your avatars were like penguins or chess pieces, or teddy bears, things like that, you know, static avatars, highly bandwidth constrained. I mean, your your typical high end home system was running at 9600 baud on something which had less power than your than your Apple Watch. does these days, considerably less power than the Apple Watch? So we had to do be very, very clever about how much data we sent and how and all that kind of stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Alexander Price  2:40  </b> <br>You have certainly come a long way since then, I'd say.

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Mitra Ardron  2:44  </b> <br>Yeah, so all the environments, of course, were pre downloaded. But, you know, textures or the 3d models. But the content of where everybody else was itself, we had to be very careful about because at 9600 baud for a shared environment, you've got to be super economic about what you're doing

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Alexander Price  3:02 </b> <br>
Going back a little bit. Were there other VRML or web based projects that sort of influenced the way that you approached your contributions to World's Inc. and VRML 2.0?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Mitra Ardron  3:12  </b> <br>
Well, because that was before VRML at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Alexander Price  3:15   </b> <br>
Right?      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Mitra Ardron  3:16  </b> <br>
Let's say VRML, I think existed at the time, but it was it was static, there was no, there was no movement, and it was like a way of describing 3D models. We didn't use it for Worlds Chat. It didn't, there wasn't really the rendering power that we needed in it at that time. We then went on while I was at Worlds, we started working on what was called Verbal 2, which was adding interaction, adding the ability to put a piece of JavaScript attached to a node so that you could describe what it did. And obviously, the part that we were interested in was then how can you then use network, the network to send instructions that could then be used to move objects in your in your world? And so that was Verbal 2 was that part Living Worlds was that was the interaction part. The first draft on Verbal one of the first drafts. Sony were too a competing one. And then we Sony and us joined forces merged. There were various other ones that were around at the time, there's other people with other ideas. But Sony and I merged our stuff, and we merged with San Diego supercomputers version. And then we evolved Silicon Graphics version. And that was what became available to in the famous the famous vote.      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Alexander Price  4:35   </b> <br>
What technological innovations do you think were the most significant in the development of Worlds Chat?      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Mitra Ardron  3:12  </b> <br>
Well, because that was before VRML at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Mitra Ardron  4:39  </b> <br>
The main thing I think, was figuring out there was the visual side, right, which was essentially taking what was in multiplayer games already. It was two and a half d, not 3d. Just because that simplifies a lot. The rendering on very low end machines. It was it was starting from the 70s trying to take a universe So the system and dump it down and make it run really slowly and really badly on a home system. We started from scratch and said, How do we design something for the the system that the median person out there has the graphics capability, the processing power and the bandwidth. And so we design from that point, in particular, for example, deciding who, whose updates you got, there's no point in telling you the precise position of an avatar, it's on the other side of the room. You, you need to know roughly, there's someone on the other side of the room, you don't actually need to know precisely where they're standing. But if you've only got a limited bandwidth, so there's a lot of innovation that went into both Worlds Chat and the development of that, about what do you send to who? When?      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Mitra Ardron  3:12  </b> <br>
Well, because that was before VRML at that time.
