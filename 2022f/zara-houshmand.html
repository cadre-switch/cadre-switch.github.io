      <p>
       <strong>Rhonda Holberton</strong> Zara, thank you so much for being with us today! Would you just introduce yourself for our readers and talk a little bit about your practice and where you're based.
	<strong>Zara Houshmand</strong> My name is Zara Houshmand and I am a writer first and foremost. Where I'm based I'm totally in transition right now, as I'm in a hotel in Turkey. I thought I was moving to New York, but it looks like I'm going back to San Francisco, but we'll see. I'm learning to just stay loose. My background was in theater. It's interesting, I was working in tech just as a way of paying the bills as a brittle tech writer working in theater when the tech work would allow me stretches of time. Then at one point, I began working with Tomiko at Worlds, and it was a unique opportunity to combine the tech experience and the theater experience because we were beginning to conceive of these worlds, virtual worlds, as essentially a set design where things happen inside of it. We were conceiving of this as how do you develop a new medium? Well, I'm sure we'll talk more about that. But just in terms of the background, it for me, came from this very fortunate overlap of theater experience and just tech grunt work.

      </p>
