      <p>
       <strong>Rhonda Holberton:</strong> Zara, thank you so much for being with us today! Would you just introduce yourself for our readers and talk a little bit about your practice and where you're based.
	  <br />
	  <br />   
	<strong>Zara Houshmand:</strong> My name is <i>Zara Houshmand </i> and I am a writer first and foremost. Where I'm based I'm totally in transition right now, as I'm in a hotel in Turkey. I thought I was moving to New York, but it looks like I'm going back to San Francisco, but we'll see. I'm learning to just stay loose. My background was in theater. It's interesting, I was working in tech just as a way of paying the bills as a brittle tech writer working in theater when the tech work would allow me stretches of time. Then at one point, I began working with Tomiko at Worlds, and it was a unique opportunity to combine the tech experience and the theater experience because we were beginning to conceive of these worlds, virtual worlds, as essentially a set design where things happen inside of it. We were conceiving of this as how do you develop a new medium? Well, I'm sure we'll talk more about that. But just in terms of the background, it for me, came from this very fortunate overlap of theater experience and just tech grunt work.
         <br />
	 <br />
	<strong>Rhonda Holberton:</strong> So there's a couple of different questions that I could segway from there, but what is your earliest experience working creatively with technology? The earliest memory you have of that.
      	 <br />
	 <br />
	 <strong>Zara Houshmand:</strong> Earliest memories are working in early creation of help systems, online help systems, as a way of documenting. What I think the first ones we worked on were HyperCard and some of the early drawing programs that Apple produced, or was Claris then. Boy this is really, you know, digging deep in memory. Going against the jetlag currents here, too. The notion of just how you structure the interaction and how you deal with the infinite number of pathways. Worked on a very early interactive video program that was installed in a bar in San Francisco as a way of not teaching, but introducing and sort of softening the resistance to conversations about HIV education in the black community in San Francisco. In a way of just sort of easing it you'd then go to the screen, and you'd try and hook up with the sky and the different pathways that a conversation could take, given their willingness to raise hard questions early. So that kind of thing, you know, just dealing with the very initial basics of interactivity. Those were the first creative challenges.
         <br />
	 <br />
	<strong>Rhonda Holberton:</strong> I love that, and we'll talk a little bit more about your background in theater, and thinking about approaching technology as a performative question rather than a technological or platform based question, or a UI even. All of those things are obviously informed. What was your first experience working with web 3d specifically, or what's kind of being commonly called the metaverse today?
	  <br />
	  <br />
	<strong>Zara Houshmand:</strong> That was at Worlds, Worlds Incorporated back in 90, or I think we started in 94. It didn't last more than two years, and that was it. This was at a time when I think there were maybe 400 websites in total on the World Wide Web. It was very, very early. The notion that we're finally coming back to this at this late stage of maturity of the web, and still not really ready to deal with it is intriguing to me.
 	  <br />
	  <br />
	<strong>Rhonda Holberton:</strong> So can you talk a little bit about what Worlds Inc is as somebody who visited the site. How would I experience Worlds Inc?
          <br />
	  <br />
	<strong>Zara Houshmand:</strong> The site was a very late piece of it. It was the notion of social media, specifically multi user social media in a visual environment. That meant the first developments of avatars; what is your visual representation in this world? You would find yourself in what was similar to then, very primitive game worlds such as 3d visualization of a game world. You would have this little halo above your head with words in it, which was your text that you were typing in. Your 3d avatar would move in a very robotic way, sliding across the space, and you would approach other robotic little avatars, and they would have text messages. It was really a way of visualizing text interactions between more or less an unlimited number of users who could drop into a space. 
          <br />
	  <br />
	 <strong>Rhonda Holberton:</strong> At that point, were you bringing your theater practice and your practice of writing and interpersonal communication into this kind of virtual social space?
	 <br />
	  <br />
	  <strong>Zara Houshmand:</strong> I was bringing it in to begin with primarily in the notion of set design. What are these physical spaces that were creating an imaginary world, and how does the design of the physical space open imaginative possibilities for these interactions to create story seeds and set a mood? Writing wasn't involved much. A lot of what we were doing was deciding what was important in this new medium. We'd have regular weekly meetings of just sort of blue sky brainstorming of what might be possible, and why it would be valuable. So I remember, for example, a discussion about should it be a priority to have facial expressions or articulated limbs. Which of these should we send the engineers off to develop? And this was before emojis even existed. So is it more realistic to have people who can move in a full bodied way, or is the priority the emotional expression? So those kinds of questions we were dealing with. What matters if you're creating an entirely new medium? For that, for example, I was drawing on puppetry. I'd studied Balinese puppetry, and we were looking at things like projection of emotion on neutral facial expressions. How the more minimalist a face is presented, the more you can relate to it empathically. I remember an example from the Balinese puppetry that the very high characters had less articulation and less fluid movements. It was the clowns and the characters that you wanted the audience to relate to. that were more articulated. So we were just pulling in things from all over the world, and all kinds of experience. One of the things that Tomiko and I especially were facing was that the engineers weren't coming from an art world, or from a performance world. The sort of assumption was that what we were building; everything had to be sci-fi. We were building space stations because that was their notion of how they imagined their imaginative, artistic gathering of ideas into the space. This put them off in that direction because that was what they were coming from. We were like no, we can do so much more with this than space stations and shopping malls.
	  <br />
	  <br />
	 <strong>Rhonda Holberton:</strong> Yeah, I was reading an interview with you where you're kind of talking about growing up as a self described Third Culture kid. I'm wondering, you know, you bring in Balinese puppetry. I'm wondering if in addition to having the kind of artistic and theatrical background, if you're also bringing a kind of multicultural experience into these discussions as well, and if those were informing some of the decisions you were making?
          <br />
	  <br />
	  <strong>Zara Houshmand:</strong> Absolutely. I think the business of having lived between cultures, and especially entering a new culture and that period of figuring out what are the rules here? You may have very weak language skills at the beginning, but you're spending a lot of time just observing how people interact and what are the unspoken languages that are happening. I had a lot of experience with that. I already understood that in terms of corporate culture, so as a freelancer working in tech, I go into one company or another company. I very quickly saw this is what's the culture here, these are what the rules here are. So those skills were just part of who I was, and I think that led to an awareness of possibilities. The business of immersion in a single culture is where you have assumptions that you don't question. So the fact that the engineers were thinking, of course, this space must be sci-fi, those are their unquestioned assumptions. I was always in a position to be able to question a bit more.
	  <br />
	  <br />
	  <strong>Rhonda Holberton:</strong> That's beautiful. That might be an interesting segway to Manzanar. Do want to just kind of briefly describe what the project is, and then talk a little bit about how the collaboration came about with Tomiko.
          <br />
	  <br />
	  <strong>Zara Houshmand:</strong> The project was an exploration of first the space of Manzanar as a setting for an examination, of how the experience of the internees during World War II, and how the Japanese Americans in the camps had parallels in imagination with the experience of Middle Eastern Americans today. Projecting that into what it would be if we were in camps today, it came out of my experience. First in this space at Manzanar, I was doing a meditation retreat nearby at the same time as the Oklahoma bombing had happened. The first assumptions were that it was a Middle Eastern terrorist. I was out of touch with the news for a week. Imagine living with these first flashes of information that were coming in before the news kind of resolved into what actually happened. I was in this space, which was very much reminding me of the landscape of Iran. High desert and shattered mountains, it to me seemed very beautiful and nostalgic. I was homesick in this landscape. I'd also very recently read "Snow Falling on Cedars", which is about the Japanese American experience there, and descriptions of the land as this desert hell. Just awareness of the different emotional reactions to the same landscape, and imagining what it would be like to be imprisoned there was the sense of homesickness and nostalgia layered on top of the initial negative reaction to the space. It became emotionally very layered and rich. All of this was just my first impressions. Tomiko and I had been talking for a long time about how to use this medium for an art piece, and what is the potential. Then we started talking from that point of view, and of course, she was really interested because of her family's experience in the camps. They weren't at Manzanar, but there's so much parallel. We just started brainstorming from that point. We went down and made visits and photographed, did a lot of research in history, and talked endlessly. And it just gradually evolved over a few years.
	  <br />
	  <br />
 	 <strong>Rhonda Holberton:</strong> And you had worked together at Worlds even before that?
	  <br />
	  <br />
	  <strong>Zara Houshmand:</strong> We were working at Worlds Inc at the time. This is what we started doing on the side and then worlds Inc died, and we continued.
	  <br />
	  <br />
	  <strong>Rhonda Holberton:</strong> As a writer and somebody who moves between lots of different types of forms of practice, how was working in this VR format? Because you'd been doing the professional type writing and consulting, did that feel like a natural place to be creating?
	  <br />
	  <br />
	  <strong>Zara Houshmand:</strong> Yeah, I think for the longest time we had a sense that this was a really interesting new medium. It was a half baked medium, which was to say we were deciding what is the medium? Of course that's an invitation to creativity. Then how do you find a way to actually use it to express something that is meaningful to you as opposed to the space stations and shopping malls?
