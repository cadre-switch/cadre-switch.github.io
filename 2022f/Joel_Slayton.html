      <h3> Juan Serna  00:00 </h3>
<p> Hi, everybody. My name is Juan Cerna DMA MFA candidate here at the Kadri Institute in San Jose State University. Today we have a guest of all guests coming to talk to us about his practices, his founding and being part of the CADRE Institute. I'd like to everybody, please introduce yourself. Hello. How are you? I'm Joel. That's right, we got Joe Slayton in that. So Joe, Thanks for Thanks for coming and spending some time with us here today. Part of my part of my work is really diving deep into some of the history of San Jose sounds a state really showing where you know, where some of this digital work comes from, so that we're not kind of forgotten in the past. So we'll quickly so tell me, how did it all start for you? What was the first thing that really got you involved? Like, let's go way back. </p>
      
      <h3>Joel Slayton  00:54 </h3>
      <p>got me involved in Indian art. </p>
 
      <h3>Juan Serna  00:57 </h3>
      <p> Yeah, art, art and art in general and computing. </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  01:00 </h3>
<p> When I was a kid, I fancied myself as becoming a photographer, or cinematographer. So I saved up all my money and bought a darkroom and set it up in my parent's bathroom. And I would process the negatives and go and hang them in the trees outside the house. So they would draw in the wind. Of course, they got all scratched and everything, which I thought was pretty amazing. So that's what hooked me on manipulating technology to make things happen </p>
 
      <h3> Juan Serna  01:30 </h3>
<p> That's awesome. I remember also doing that kind of stuff, and you get little scratches in it, making it so that was the kind of your first art exhibition </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  01:39 </h3>
<p> exhibition or not, but I still actually have the photographs that I made from that. <p>
 
      <h3> Juan Serna  01:44 </h3>
<p> Oh, that's awesome. And so then, so you're doing that. And then kind of talk to me a little bit more about what happened after that. </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  01:53 </h3>
<p> I thought I wanted to become a lawyer. So I went to school in political science. And along the way, found out that I didn't have the chops to do that kind of thinking. And I ended up in the photo and cinema program at Ohio State University where I did my graduate work. Oh, nice that I think I kind of got kicked out of that you got kicked out of that same reason; for the negative say. </p>
 
      <h3> Juan Serna  02:29 </h3>
      <p> They weren't ready for your art. </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  02:31 </h3>
<p> I like to mess with stuff that was dirty and manipulated. The processes of photography and cinema didn't make things happen. And that wasn't what the programs were about. But to my fortunate benefit. My graduate advisor introduced me to some folks at MIT, and they said, Hey, come on up. And I ended up being there for seven years or so. </p>
 
      <h3> Juan Serna  02:58 </h3>
      <p> Wow, MIT. So what and then, so what do you start doing there </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  03:01 </h3>
<p> I worked in a laboratory called the visible language workshop, which was one of the five laboratories that ultimately formed the Media Lab. At MIT, it was a place for misfit designers and artists to go and experiment with emerging tools, technology and other kinds of tools as well. So it was a good fit for me. </p>
 
      <h3> Juan Serna  03:27 </h3>
<p> So you, you've always been working with emerging technologies and mixing technologies were so while you were working there, well, some of the first things that you know, really kind of, you know, except for being part of the just the wild ones. </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  03:40 </h3>
<p> Well, this was quite a while ago. So we're talking 1976-78. Okay, and so this is pre personal computer, this is pre cell phone, this is pre everything really. And a lot of the experimentation that was being done was to figure out how to make computers visually represent the thing you wanted to print, or at least put, put in some form of output. So there was research being done on both sides of that equation, you know, the mechanisms for outputting it and high quality, high definition and the mechanisms for the tools that would be required to be able to manipulate images directly on the screen. All the stuff that we take for granted today; using the tools, you know, whether it's Photoshop or whatever, they originated somewhere. So MIT was one of the places where a lot of the tools were being experimented with and we were inventing the things that we needed to use; it was being done at the lab bench. </p>
 
      <h3> Juan Serna  04:50 </h3>
<p> It's wild that you say that now, right? When you were saying, “we needed to figure out a way to print images.” Today people might think oh, print something and like a 3d printer, but just the idea that, at one point, we didn't have the ability to just create something on this screen that so easily to, you know, change in code. </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  05:11 </h3>
<p> We didn't have the ability to see it on the screen in a way that it would look similar to the thing you were going to print. And whether it was 3d or not, that's kind of irrelevant. In fact, I mean, a lot of experimentation was being done in printing technologies or delivery output technologies to deliver the output, if you will, from the computer and other kinds of forms. So 3d was an obvious one. So why can't you print in 3d? I'm not talking about the kind of printing that we do today with many 3d printers. But could you wrap a printer around the building and have it spray the building? That kind of thing. </p>
 
      <h3> Juan Serna  05:51 </h3>
      <p> That's sweet. How big were those computers? </p>
 
<h3> Joel Slayton  05:57 </h3>
<p> Well, they weren't that big, you know, several refrigerator size machines to make the thing happen that your cell phone today is about 1000 times more powerful. </p>
 
      <h3> Juan Serna  06:10 </h3>
<p> Wow. So then, so you're working at MIT, you're you're you know, you're figuring out how to actually get something to actually get into a screen and actually be, you know, something that you can see and eventually, you know, work with, what would happen after that would you do? </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  06:25 </h3>
<p> Well, I mean, I should say, I didn't care about any of that, either. Oh, no. I mean, it was not my goal to make something that other people can use. My goal is to make, to code software, to build tools for myself to use to make the things I wanted to make. And they just happen to be things that other people need. So a good example of this was a colleague, Ron McNeil, who was in the lab, who was a co-partner in the lab. One day I was sitting on a lab bench with him, and he needed a way to get an image into the computer. So how do you do that? You're right. So you could do a little bit with the video. But that's so wrong, the resolution was so poor. So he decided he had to make a digital camera. So he built a digital camera out of an old Nikon. He stripped the, you know, the film plane off, and put some electronics in it. And lo and behold, you could scan a red, green, blue pass and put an image up on the screen and about 512 lines of resolution, which at the time was like high fidelity. And there it was, a digital camera. So you know, not that this wasn't being done elsewhere. Other people weren't working on these kinds of tools. But that was the kind of thing people were doing in the lab. And I remember sitting with him and saying, hey, Ron, you know, you could put images in memory. And Ron says, why would you want to do that? </p>
 
      <h3> Juan Serna  08:09 </h3>
      <p> So you can recall it over time… </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  08:12 </h3>
<p> Those stars had to begin somewhere. They had to have a nascent sort of almost naivete beginning. And what it revealed to me was that artists, if artists do what they do best, which is just experiment with their resources and tools; for some critical reason, just do that. The byproducts of that are the kinds of innovation that don't happen in any other context. </p>
 
      <h3> Juan Serna  08:45 </h3>
<p> Yeah. I mean, you had to use your imagination;  playing, tinkering, thinking, and using the universe to help you, you know, create and bring things and now everyone uses and it's like, commonplace.</p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  08:58 </h3>
      <p> Yeah, it's commonplace. </p>
 
      <h3> Juan Serna  08:59 </h3>
<p> So what happened? But I mean, I couldn't even imagine though that, okay, I'm going to take apart this camera, we're going to take away the film part, put some technology in it and boom, but see, that's what creators do. Yeah. So after you're done working there, what, what happens to you next? </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  09:16 </h3>
<p> I taught at MIT for seven years or so, and decided that California was where it was really happening. The Media Lab at MIT was, the ground had been broken, they were going to build that. I decided for myself that as an artist, I wanted to be here in Silicon Valley and moved out in early ‘81, something like that. I set myself up in a studio up in Emeryville and started to work by introducing myself to tech companies and trying to infiltrate those tech companies so that they would let me play with their resources and tools and make things that they didn't know their machines could do. </p>
 
      <h3> Juan Serna  10:15 </h3>
<p> That's awesome. That's rad. So it's like, something you couldn't do today; you can't just walk in [to big tech companies] today. So now you're here, you're in Silicon Valley. This is where it's hyped up, right? We got Atari. We got hackers, we got all these things. All these innovators are coming. You're now part of the party. Now you're part of the scene. So who are we working with around that time? </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  10:38 </h3>
<p> Well, there was no, there really wasn't an academic center, anywhere that you could go affiliate yourself with; that didn't exist. And so I started to shop around the idea to the universities here in the Bay Area, about starting a laboratory for artists to do experimentation with emerging technologies. And so I went to all the obvious places, you know, Stanford and Berkeley and elsewhere, and there really wasn't an appetite for it at that time. Or I wasn't clear about what the benefit was. Little did they know, but little did they know. And it turns out that it was here at San Jose State, that the chair of the department at that time was a guy, a fella named Fred Frederick Spratt. And Frederick, and a number of his colleagues here at the university, decided that San Jose State was in this really sort of sweet spot, because of the scale and size of its art department. In the CSU system, as was one of the largest, it was in this really great position to become the kind of leading academic center in the Bay Area. Responding to what was released, he saw a clear direction of new emerging technologies. So he started a conference; the first National Conference on art and technology in the country happened here, it was called CADRE (Computers in Art, Design, Research and Education). And it brought together just a host of people who were working across all kinds of different lines of Creative Inquiry, from performance in theater, and video and writing and sculpture and, you know, in the union. And that conference resulted in the university and the art department, art and designs department at the time, creating a faculty line. I had been involved with a conference and through that, I was offered a faculty position. Fantastic, the good news there was they offered me a faculty position, but they had no money. But they had a couple rooms, and they had a couple of rooms and they were very generous about allowing me to do whatever I wanted to do as long as it was out of the way. That was basically the deal; let me do what I want to do and stay away.
      </p> 
      <h3> Juan Serna  13:44 </h3>
      <p> Like, okay, you give me some toys. </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  13:47 </h3>
      <p> The rest there? We're gonna talk. </p>
 
      <h3> Juan Serna  13:49 </h3>
      <p> So how did you come about funding? Like, how did the money come? Who did start talking to? </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  13:57 </h3>
<p> I rolled up in the back of the art department. There used to be a grass parking lot over there. Where you could sleep overnight in your car,  which a lot of people did, by the way. So I rolled up to the first day of work and I had a trunk load of Commodore VIC 20, and Commodore 64 computers that I was able to get Commodore to donate. And the great thing about those machines was that you program them in Basic. Yeah. And they had a game port that you could stick paper clips in, and then alligator clip them to control things outside of the box. And so that's how it all began. 
      </p>
      
      <h3> Juan Serna  14:51 </h3>
      <p> The beginning of hacking. </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  14:55 </h3>
<p>It was very much about that. It was kind of a brute force way of dealing with, you know, the available technology. But it was an entry point. At that point Apple had released its 2E machine. And then we got a few of those and they weren't very good.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Juan Serna  15:18 </h3>
      <p> You're like, we're not going to be playing Oregon Trail. You design [the programs]. </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  15:23 </h3>
<p> The cool thing about it, well, you could open the top, and you could go buy us a board and stick it in here. That was kind of cool. So you had access to the hardware, which was nice, but wasn't clear exactly what direction all that was going to move. Somewhere along the line another colleague in the Art and Design area Del Coates who was in the Industrial Design program, he and I got together and wrote some grants for funding. And we were able to get a couple of companies here to donate some rather impressive computing resources to the university that would allow us to do some serious coding and development with. That changed everything.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Juan Serna  16:16 </h3>
      <p> What were some of the first things that you started developing with that system? </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  16:19 </h3>
<p> Well, first off teaching artists to code and higher level programming languages, on graphics machines that were the most powerful, that you could buy. And doing it in an environment where the work was networked, at least in a local area network. It was all shared in a kind of sandbox-like mentality where you'd write a piece of code, somebody else could borrow and steal it and hack it into their own work. So the kinds of things that came out were real time computationally driven graphics, visualizations, of whatever somebody wanted to try to make or produce. It was super interesting.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Juan Serna  17:14 </h3>
<p> So as soon as people started hearing about this, like other people from different programs, they're like, Wow, they got these supercomputers. Not only other universities, but did you start seeing an influx of people starting to come in and getting really interested?
      </p>

      <h3> Joel Slayton  17:31 </h3>
<p> It was slow. I mean, it was a slow growth. At the university, we were by far had the most powerful resources, which also led to laying fiber into the building, which gave us network access. And we could run our own network hub out of the lab, and we didn't have all the centralized computing stuff to deal with. Which meant students could experiment with the internet as it came online. We were right at the cusp of being able to do things, yeah. With it, play with it, and see how to break it and make it do new things. But yeah, there was, you know, that gateway to Silicon Graphics, the old Silicon Graphics company giving us tons of resources, oh, geez, tons of resources. Very, very generous. And that provided high end, computational machines that can be used on an individual basis with students. 
      </p>
      
      <h3> Juan Serna  18:36 </h3>
      <p> And then you all just kept making stuff. And the imagination started. </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  18:40 </h3>
<p> It wasn't all about graphics, there was always this interest in hardware, there was always an interest in, you know, human machine interface. What could it be? How to rethink it? How to, how to challenge ourselves to imagine, yeah, what else these tools could do besides all the obvious stuff.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Juan Serna  19:02 </h3>
<p> All the stuff that you're like, well now how can we build it? And that takes us to where we're at now. So now, are you still working with some of the same people? Do you still see some of the some of these groups and people that you're working with back then?
      </p>
      
      <h3> Joel Slayton  19:34 </h3>
<p> Not so much. I mean, I have colleagues from MIT. Certainly, I have some relationships with those folks. But yeah, certainly, there's a there's a long lineage of graduate students from the CADRE program, that I have close relationships with
      </p>
      
      <h3> Juan Serna  19:54 </h3>
<p> As a Professor Emeritus, how's that make you feel like knowing that you started this, you know, you helped develop this program, and you've seen them graduate and move out to the real world. What does that make you feel like?
      </p>

      <h3> Joel Slayton  20:09 </h3>
<p> I think the most gratifying thing is that there were really good artists. And then the second thing is that they went on into universities or academic programs all over the place and helped shape the field. So I mean, you can't go anywhere in the world today and not find a digital media art design, something or other some incarnation of it. And but the thinking behind the early methodology of, well, what role artists play in all this? I think a lot of that originated in laboratories like the one we started here at San Jose State. And those people went out into the world and it was less about shaping industry, because industry is going to do what it does, but more about shaping, how to think about how the arts fit into this bigger picture of technological society and where it's where it's sort of cascading to
      </p>
      
      <h3> Juan Serna  21:15 </h3>
      <p> just like you did at MIT. </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  21:15 </h3>
      <p> Same model. </p>
 
      <h3> Juan Serna  21:18 </h3>
<p> It's obviously a working model. So when, so how about SWITCH Journal? So talk a little bit about SWITCH Journal? How did that come about? </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  21:32 </h3>
<p> I was teaching a grad seminar. And I always try to keep the graduate seminar sort of focused topically, on something, you know. And with a good dose of theory, and I'll kind of go along with the practice side of things. The internet had appeared, it was here, and it was something to contend with. We were very early in the game of getting, like I said, fiber and our own servers to handle that were autonomous and isolated so we could experiment. And one of the very early uses of the internet, of course, was the evolution of the web. The web was coming online, and everyone's trying to figure out what the hell this thing is, and what it might be good for. It was pretty clear that one of the things that it could do would be to be a platform for publishing.
But no one really knew what that meant. What does an online publication look like? And how do you get to it? Why would you interact? Where does interaction fit in? You know, there were a lot of issues there. And so we started by getting a small group of graduate students who would be committed to making this thing happen. And we just did it. We just invented as we went, but it was a really wonderful platform, because it gave the grad students carte blanche to go into the world and talk to anybody about anything. Right. They found a way of featuring the interviews and discussions and then it became a platform where professionals from outside of San Jose State around the world were comfortable publishing their work or doing interviews, or whatever. We kept it going for quite awhile.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Juan Serna  24:18 </h3>
<p> I'm working with Professor Holberton on bringing it back. And as we were beginning the research, one of the first [articles] we read was about you, what you did. What's interesting, was also thinking about how long it would take to load that one picture at the time. That one picture, but you guys were so ahead of the game in 1994.
 </p>
      
      <h3> Joel Slayton  24:45 </h3>
<p> It was all coded, you know, scripted in, in early HTML, and which everyone has to learn, but I mean, that wasn't the problem. The problem was that every single issue. You know, so every issue, it was like, hey, know what else we could do this or we could do that and let's try this or let's, you know, and then as you know, other more sophisticated scripting, software support came along had to incorporate that and, and so there was not there was never a standard publication format. Yeah, for it, the formats were invented by whoever was working on it each issue. And that's certainly got to be part of the challenge that Rhonda and others have of translating that into something that is now you know, accessible to a wider audience.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Juan Serna  25:47 </h3>
<p> So in the beginning Web One was just changing constantly right? I remember the first time I ever got online it was AOL and some Netscape; I was learning about it in the 90s. Because, you know, I was born in 1976.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Juan Serna  26:11 </h3>
      <p> So what about, what about the C5 group? </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  26:16 </h3>
<p> C5 came about, because I had an opportunity to do an exhibition. And I wanted to do something radically different than I had done before. And there were several grad students that I had worked with and had become professional colleagues with and I invited them to join me as a small kind of collective to work on an exhibition that I was going to do, but also see what else we would do together. It was sort of like an extension of, of CADRE, an extension of the university without all the encumbrances of the problems you have when you know like paperwork, just all the stuff that happens when people pay attention to what you're doing. 
But it was formed as an early LLC, and as a company. And the idea was, they have one foot in the research world and another foot in the art world and another foot in the business world, and be able to find that sweet spot where what we were doing as artists sort of, could be supported by or facilitated by those other pivot points. And, low and behold, that worked pretty well. So C5 lasted, had a good 10 years of activity together as a group, there were different people at different times coming in and out of it but we really focused on thinking about big data, networks, mapping technologies, and just how to think about those things in really experimental ways. And so yeah, C5 was exhibited all around the world, in terms of, you know, biennials, and museums and festival programs, that kind of thing. But it was also taken seriously when you'd sit in a boardroom, say, at Apple or Adobe, or wherever, and you could sort of talk about with them, how they could support us to open up, say, for example, how cell phones might map your locations. But you know, again, those nascent ideas have to come from someplace. And I'm not claiming that we, you know, we invented the idea. We didn't, but we certainly created a way to do it. 
And so the, like one of the the projects involved mapping, the performance behaviors of the sea five group has attempted to climb 10 high altitude volcanoes around the world and novices not knowing what they're doing likely to kill themselves. But by mapping the location using GPS to map the location, using digital elevation mapping to map the altitude, you could create these interactive maps that would show not only where a person is but what the obstacles around them are. So as they're moving through space, moving through that terrain, you can begin to look at the strategies of navigating those spaces, and then model those into new spaces that hadn't been yet explored. So the equivalent of it would be if you know how to drive a car through Manhattan, you probably know how to drive a car through LA. So take the skill set from the Manhattan side and just apply it to the LA side and see how it works. Let it guide you. So it was all about the scanning of facilitation of guiding mapping navigation, and large data.

      <h3> Juan Serna  30:30 </h3>
      <p> And how’s the crews going now? Are you in contact with some of them? </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  30:34 </h3>
      <p> Oh, no, it exploded like a nasty rock band; vaporized,  as it should. </p>
 
      <h3> Juan Serna  30:43 </h3>
      <p> Like a star. </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  30:45 </h3>
<p> You do all the good stuff, and then everybody fights to the death. And then, you know, some people survive and go on to do things, others give up. </p>
 
      <h3> Juan Serna  30:56 </h3>
<p> So you've exhibited all over the world. And so what's one of your, you know, I think like for yourself, like, what's something that you're most proud of? Are some of the things that you've, you know, developed and shown?
      </p>
      
      <h3> Joel Slayton  31:11 </h3>
<p> I don't know, that's a hard question to answer. Because when you look back on a career of making things, as an artist, I think you're so critical. You don't really like anything.
      </p> 
      
      <h3> Juan Serna  31:23 </h3>
<p> I've never, I've never felt like that. </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  31:25 </h3>
<p> Yeah, right. Right? So like, Oh, what did you do that was really amazing. I mean, I have really fond memories of a projects, there was one that was at a biennial in Argentina that was related to the projects, I was just talking about the mapping. So one of the outcomes of it was the production of these very high resolution 3d printed models before there were 3d printers. So we got at a way to do that. They were cut from foam, I had them in these metallic briefcases. And part of the art project was about the transport of them. So taking them and walking across the entire Buenos Aires urban environment with these two metallic suitcases, and to deliver them to the museum where the only thing was required was to open up the suitcase ready to go, you know, and it's so it's for me, it's it's not always about just the outcome, it's about a lot of the process and about the artwork isn't limited to the outcome. It's about a whole bunch of aspects of the work that you're doing, you know that art can exist in multiple forms in multiple places and multiple ways simultaneously. And you have to kind of look at the whole context of it to get a handle on why it's important. </p>

      <h3> Juan Serna  33:01 </h3>
<p> So what about the Zero1 festival? Can you talk about a little bit about that stuff? I remember, as a kid it was something I used to, or not as a kid I was a young adult, it was something I loved.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Joel Slayton  33:15 </h3>
<p> Well, it seemed like a good idea. The time for Silicon Valley, specifically San Jose, to be host of the largest international cultural event in the world. That would celebrate art's relationship with emerging technologies. Yeah, it seemed like a no-brainer. And so we just did that; made that happen. And it started by first bringing the International Symposium of Electronic Arts to San Jose, and piggybacking on that already established conference event to activate all of our rather large set of partners in realizing that vision, including the University in the city of San José, and many tech companies who helped underwrite the cost. 
Biennials are very expensive to produce. They're, they're really expensive to do. And we were committed to bringing artists internationally from here. So you have to manage the economics at scale.  So there were three iterations of the Biennial. They brought over 650 artists to San Jose from around the world to do installations, both public art and museum, museum exhibitions, performance theater. I mean, it was a spectacle. We very quickly went from zero miles per hour to 300 miles per hour. And we were the international showcase for a period of time where, if you wanted to see, see really great things in the US and North America especially, we'd be the go-to place. Zero1 is still alive and well as an organization. But it's no longer located here in San Jose. 
      </p>
      
      <h3> Juan Serna  35:32 </h3>
<p> What you did first, for people like me and other people that have never experienced something like that. </p>
 
      <h3> Joel Slayton  35:41 </h3>
<p> You don't do any of this on your own. I can't take credit for it. There were tons of smart people; it was about the collaborative vision and getting the right people in the room at the right time. Taking advantage of the moment. San José State University played a really significant role in getting Zero1 off the ground, both financially, but also just in terms of its enthusiastic support from the administration, from the President on down. And that went a long way in convincing other partners to jump on. In the end the biennial covered the entire Bay Area involved 48 institutions, from San Francisco MoMA to large footprints on the public art side with major commissions that were made. It was a very, very successful enterprise. It was just successful and very expensive. And, as all things good, they run their course.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Juan Serna  37:07 </h3>
<p> We could be talking here for hours. I mean, just listening to what you're saying is just inspiring. Are you taking pictures now? Have you gotten back into digital photography? 
      </p>
      
      <h3> Joel Slayton  37:23 </h3>
<p> No, I don't, I'm not a I'm not a media artist, I don't think of myself that way at all. I think of myself as an artist, and I, if anything, I come out of a more of a conceptual art background. In the early days I was talking about earlier, where learning how to collaborate and working with people came out of me trying to make a film; it’s natural that you don't do anything by yourself. You can't. And so, I had these models for how to build organizational systems and collaborations in my head. C5 was one of those and CADRE was one of those. And now I'm working on a new one. I try using whatever tools, resources, technologies that you need, or have to invent to get there. And so yeah, the answer to your question is, am I making photographs? Yes, I'm making some photographs. I guess, I don't know what to call them; digital artifacts?
      </p>
      
      <h3> Juan Serna  38:34 </h3>
<p> So you're still in there coding. And so what do you think about so now we've gone through, you know, we went through Web1, Web2, and we're starting Web3, what's the future? What do you see for the emerging technologies?
      </p>
      
      <h3> Joel Slayton  38:53 </h3>
<p> That's the question I anticipated, you'd be asking me when I came here today. It's a very tough question. I mean, it's so much easier to predict what industry is going to do. Yeah, or where it's moving. And therefore where the larger culture is kind of moving; where pop-culture is moving. Almost anybody can kind of say, oh, it's probably going to look like this in 20-30 years. On the art-side of things it is much more difficult to figure out. Where are those unpredictable spaces that artists can kind of infiltrate and play and experiment with, to make things that hadn't been made before? Or maybe it's not even so much that they haven't been made before, but just to figure out why that environment where experimentation matters. And, specifically, art research experimentation matters. 
It wasn't that we didn't see the ubiquity of computing infiltrating every aspect of life 30 years ago. Everybody knew that was going to happen. But, some of the things are still a little unclear to me. I can't speak for anybody else, but to me, one of those has to do with social software, software that's acting on your behalf. For you and for all intents and purposes, is making decisions about your, or thinking. Not just as a prosthetic. Not something, just extending who you are. But a proxy, a proxy identity, in a sense, and that's not clear at all, to me, where that's taken us.  It goes down this cascade; a super schizophrenic, crazy path, and you could be very easily to do. At least least to some sort of equanimity between people, because now you're able to slip and slide across every line of everything. Yeah. Right. You can, you can be part of chaos or bliss.  I'm not even sure any of that makes any sense. I don't see myself as predicting things. But, you know, it's an area I think it's gonna be important, and that then leads into the whole artificial life piece.
      </p>
      
      <h3> Juan Serna  42:10 </h3>
<p> When you were talking about how sometimes as artists, or just in general, you have to create a space to do what you want to do,  it reminds me of our New Art City, you know, that was develope out of a CADRE MFA student’s need to show their stuff for graduation [during COVID] and what do they do? They bring it, hey, well since we can't get together, we're gonna use some technology that's already there; revamp it, and to make it look like we need it to be for the place that we are in. 
Well, thank you so much. It was a pleasure. You're invited over here anytime. I'd like to just walk the halls with you one of these days. As this develops, we'll be talking some more hopefully. Maybe I could help you build something or you could teach me. 
Thank you everyone. We've got Joel Slaytonn here, one of the masters and just it's such a pleasure to talk to him and pick his brain and you gave me something to think about. Thank you, Joel. 
      </p>
