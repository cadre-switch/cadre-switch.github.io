        Mission
      </h2>
        
      <p>
        SWITCH is interested in fostering a critical viewpoint on issues and developments in the multiple crossovers between art and technology. Its main focus in on questioning and analyzing, as well as reporting and discussing these new art forms as they develop, in hopes of encouraging dialogue and possible collaboration with others who are working and considering similar issues.  <br/><br/>
          
          SWITCH aims to critically evaluate developments in art and technology in order to contribute to the formation of alternative viewpoints with the intention of expanding the arena in which new art and technology emerge.<br/><br/>

          About
      </h2>
	    
      <p>
        In 1995 SWITCH began what has become a valuable historic documentation of the evolving theoretical and critical discourse within new media.<br/><br/>
          
        Since then, many artists, techonologists, and thorists have contributed to the Journal and have shaped the ways we think about and use technology. From the Fall 1995 virtual reality issue to the Fall 1998 electronic gender issue SWITCH has been at the forefront of seismic cultural and theoretical shifts.<br/><br/>
