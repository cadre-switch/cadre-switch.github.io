      <p>
	This article explores the topic of Internet Art, and the distinctive characteristics associated with this form of new media art. The discussion follows the ideas of useless web pages, multiple manifestations of interactivity, surveillance, and physical presence, and their relationship with Internet Art. These qualities are analyzed in conjunction with the concept of the vastness of the internet and the enormous amount of artistic capacities that it offers artists.

      <p>
	Internet art and its related forms of art are incredibly distinct from other forms of art. Internet art has shifted greatly throughout the years from the impact of the pandemic on how artists share their work with the viewer to shifts in public perception of internet art throughout its development. Internet art offers vast and endless artistic opportunities and possibilities to both the artists and the viewer in regards to collaboration, data visualizations, spatial bridges, and accessibility including how internet art is showcased in a virtual space that can be accessed and experienced by people from numerous different parts of the world.      </p> 
	   
	<p> 
	There are numerous qualities specific to internet art such as its relationships with interactivity, accessibility, and the surveillance of user behaviors as well as its existence as an ‘indefinite’ virtual medium. Early internet art often touched on topics of censorship and the freedom of speech similarly to other forms of new media art. An example of one of these early works is Antoni Muntadas’s 1994 project The File Room. Muntadas’s project featured a room full of black filing cabinets with a single computer that allowed the viewer to view and add to a censorship related online archive.
	</p>
	    
	<p>
	Another form of internet art that subverts the original nature or purpose of the internet is useless web pages. These web pages can be characterized by sites that provide meaningless data, present specific personal details, or offer irrelevant information. Not only do these web pages exist outside the areas of logic and purpose, but they also represent the creator’s refusal of meaning whether intentional or unintentional. This quality connects useless web pages to the anti-art characteristics of Dada, a movement that emerged well before the age of the internet. 
	</p>

	<p>
	Interactivity is a large component of the internet as a whole, which conveniently allows for artists to incorporate interactivity within their internet artworks such as with Muntadas’s The File Room that was previously mentioned. Komar & Melamid’s 1995 web project The Most Wanted Paintings is a prime example of the incorporation of interactivity in internet art. This artwork is the culmination from the results of a poll about the “people’s” ideal painting in which the artists created both the most and least wanted paintings for each country represented by the poll. By involving input from the viewer, the relationship between the artist and the viewer is further developed, creating a more intimate viewing experience with an increased quality of engagement. While this form of interactivity may be possible to achieve through other forms of new media art, there are employments of interactivity that can only be achieved through internet art.	
	 </p>
	    
	<p>
	For instance, the interactivity within internet artworks may also involve the social interaction amongst the viewers and users. For instance, certain projects may build virtual communities which allow for users to communicate with each other about the themes and concepts presented within the artworks. This also creates and develops an atmosphere of collaboration between the viewers who work collectively to find meaning within the work. While the presence of collaboration implies the possibility of facts and the truth being skewed, these interactions build immense layers on the conceptual foundations of the artworks.
	 </p>
	    
	<p>
	The idea of surveillance is another component commonly associated with internet art. Surveillance often coincides with censorship and data retention in which users’ different internet behaviors are often tracked by different internet entities and used to mold their internet experience commercially, and sometimes maliciously. Internet art that deals with surveillance frequently allows the artist to experiment with and test the level of control the users have within their work as commentary on the level of control users have on the internet, in general. Different methods of experimentation with this control may involve feigned interaction which tricks users into believing they have a direct impact on the web project when the viewer, in fact, does not. Yuri Pattison’s 2013 web project RE Liable COMmunications exemplifies this experimentation. Pattison’s project includes the use of archived materials and information related to the Soviet Coup of 1991 as an imitation of an educational resource. While the interface of the project relates to the level of control allowed to the user such as through the floating rock that continuously obscures the user’s view of the presented documents, the historical contents of the piece showcase the reality of data privacy on the internet and how certain personal information may not be as secure as users may believe.
	 </p>
	    
	<p>
	One facet of internet art that may be unique to the medium is the presence or existence of the artworks which is characterized by portability and accessibility. Since internet art exists outside of the physical world within a virtual realm, many of these artworks are accessible to people all over the world who do not have to travel to a certain location to experience the artwork; all the viewer needs is internet access. In addition, as a result of the pandemic and social distancing, the mode in which artists, galleries, and museums have been able to share art has been impacted. The pandemic’s influence is reflected by Castell di Rivoli’s Digital Cosmos platform. This virtual exhibition, curated by Giulia Colletti features a variety of digital works from video to audio to artist web discussions, and was launched and opened in March 2020. While internet art primarily includes artworks that were created for and exist solely on the internet, the internet also allows for artworks that exist within the physical world to be shared virtually to expand the viewer’s access to the works. Additional ways that artists have begun to increasingly share their work virtually involve social media platforms and online services that allow them to sell their work to viewers and customers, increasing the commercialization of art.
	</p>
	    
	<p>
	While internet art can be closely associated with interactivity, surveillance, critique, and space and presence, internet art also gives artists a tremendous amount of creative freedom with their work that transcends many of the topics discussed here. From its distinct aesthetic properties to its unique presentation characteristics, internet art offers a variety of different licenses to artists that traditional mediums cannot with numerous subcategories of internet art for viewers to explore.
