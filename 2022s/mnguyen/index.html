	 <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout art history&rsquo;s timeline, artists, politics, and capitalism have had a fascinating relationship with one another. It would have been nearly impossible for an artist to be detached from capitalism and patronage in the ancient world; art patrons were the life force that sustained all artists, acting as their sole financial support. This, of course, is a far cry from the art world of our current day and age: the number of staunchly anti-capitalist and anti-patronage independent artists is far higher today compared to any other time in art history. What incited such a dramatic shift in the art world? How have artists gone from total dependency on patronage and capitalism to openly opposing and criticizing it in their work? In this article, I am going to be examining the causal factors in what has brought the art world from its patron and capital-driven roots to its radically politicized modern equivalent.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back to the early beginnings of art history&rsquo;s timeline, we see a vastly different world than that of today. Art in the ancient world was driven mainly by patronage and capital: art as a means of individual expression, as we know it primarily today, was nowhere near as prominent a concept in the ancient world. Instead, artists of the old world fashioned art to serve a different purpose. Upon examining artistic artifacts from the earliest civilizations, we glean a better understanding of what art was made for&ndash;to be exhibitions of political, religious, and magisterial systems. This was the standard for a majority of ancient art. Statues, paintings, and drawings were commissioned by the upper ruling class to be used for temples, palaces, and public places. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gudea, Prince of Lagash</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (ca. 2140 B.C.) is a prime example of ancient art patronage. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gudea, Prince of Lagash</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a statue made in the likeness of Gudea, a Mesopotamian prince who ruled over part of Sumeria, and was created to exhibit the prince&rsquo;s majesty and royalty, as well as appease the Sumerian god Ningishzida, who represented the welfare of crops and produce.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As shown in the making of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gudea, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">artists of the ancient world had taken on a vastly different vocation than that of today&rsquo;s artists, serving a role more akin to craftsmen and artisans. This particular type of craftsmen artist made up the majority of artists in the western world, with their specific religious, magisterial, and political subjects and styles of work primarily being the standard of art for a majority of history. This was one reason why ancient art was not as strikingly political as it is today: artists did not seek to create works that challenged the status quo or speak about divisive issues in their work, but rather to complete the job given by their patrons. Art could not serve as a vehicle for political and personal expression because artists were so heavily bound to the will of their patrons. Ancient art, as a majoritive whole, was made for the sake of pragmatism, and the purposes of the ruling class.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the grand scheme of art history, there are of course exceptions to this statement, but the overwhelming majority of ancient art was made for the aforementioned purposes. This begs the question, the pressing matter on which this article focuses&ndash;how did such a dramatic shift occur from the ancient art world to the modern? With an already established context of the art of the ancient world in mind, let us examine the pivotal point in art history&rsquo;s shift towards artistic independence: the Renaissance.</span></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Renaissance was an esteemed cultural, philosophical, scientific, and artistic revival that swept across Europe in the 15th to 16th centuries. Its renowned impact across the western world is remarkable; the teaching of the Renaissance and its holistic effect on all aspects of our modern lives is mandated across almost all schools in America, given the profundity and significance of the movement as a whole. The beliefs and innovations that transpired during the Renaissance would ultimately catalyze the western art world to no longer be dominated by capital and patronage, but by creative freedom and individual expression. The Renaissance birthed a groundbreaking concept that would go on to change the very ethos of art for centuries to follow: Renaissance humanism.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Renaissance humanism is a heavily loaded concept with many of its historical proponents varying in beliefs, it, at its core, boils down to the belief that mankind is inherently valuable and capable of greatness. This belief would serve as the starting point for artists to become recognized as individuals with inherent creative abilities and as people capable of creating works worthy of viewing apart from the involvement and support from a patron. Despite the groundbreaking significance that Renaissance humanism has had in changing the way artists and their artwork were considered by society, it did not cause much immediate change for artists; like artists of the ancient world, many Renaissance artists were still tied to patronage as a source of financial wellbeing. Artists were still creative vessels rather than independent creative agents. The art world would instead experience a gradual change over time, with the ideals of Renaissance humanism slowly permeating into the thinking of the general public. Renaissance humanist ideals would eventually come to a climactic manifestation with the arrival of the Enlightenment period of the 18th century.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the western world&rsquo;s perception of man&rsquo;s innate value changing drastically in comparison to its ancient counterpart, the opportunity for artists to detach themselves from the will of patrons, capitalism, and political systems continued to grow more and more as history progressed. Early modern artists, greatly influenced by Renaissance and Enlightenment-era principles of individuality, more fervently challenged the world around them. Artists&rsquo; constant challenging of the world around them had caused art to evolve at an immeasurable rate; aesthetic and conceptual boundaries were pushed further beyond what could have been imagined, eventually leading up to the birth of modern art as a movement. With artists&rsquo; inherent creativity recognized and the need for a patron no longer present, the primary inhibiting factors of art&rsquo;s growth were removed.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patronage and capital were the driving factors behind artists for a great majority of the art history, with the independent and less pragmatic art of our current day and age making up only a fraction of said history. The ancient western world&rsquo;s radically different views on human worth, the purpose of art, and the role of artists in society drove art and artists alike to be greatly influenced by patrons and capital. The changes that came to pass as a result of the Renaissance and Enlightenment movements altered the course of art history as a whole with a massive paradigm shift in how we view art, artists, and humanity as a whole.&nbsp;</span></p>
