      <h1>
        Editor's Note
      </h1>

       <p>
            Switch Journal was published by CADRE (a research program housed in the Art Department at San José State University, whcih has evolved into the Digital Medai Art Program in the same department) students regularly from 1994-2003. In 2001, the original 15 issues of the HTML journal were updated to match current web styling of the time.  The V2 journal was published in conjunction with the 16th issue. Two more issues were published using the same template. Issues 19-27 were published between 2003-2011 using bespoke styling.
              <br /><br />

            In Spring 2022, studnets enrolled in the Digital Media Art Seminars at SJSU reveiwed each article in issues 1-18 and worked with the MLK library to write abstracts and provide metadata that have been used in the archiving of SWITCH in the Library's digital repository,       <a href="https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/switch/">Scholarworks</a>. As of Spring 2024, the archiving work is still ongoing. 
              <br /><br />

            For this issue, studnets compared the articles written in the 90s and early 00s to similar articles written between 2017-2022. Students discussed major technological, cultural, political, and economic shifts that might account for the differences in perspective and tone. They then used this dialogue as a lens through with to view contemporary concerns they have. 
              <br /><br />

            This was a time when the world just starting to come out of the pandemic, where interpersonal communication, business, and education had largely been mediated by networked communication technologies for two years. What emerged was a focus on Web 3 technologies; namely blockchain, AI, and a resurgence of Web 3D as well as a re-emergence of some of the conerns facing Web 1.0 and a redressing of the social and economic fallout from Web 2.
              <br /><br />

            The students who contributed articles for this issue a embraced a strategy of looking back as a way to look forward. I am honored to have worked with them to published this issue and begin the archiving work of almost 40 years of SWITCH.

            <i>Poster for the CADRE Art & Technology Conference, 1984 </i> <br /><br />
            
            <strong>SJSU's CADRE Laboratory for New Media began in 1984 </strong> as an art and technology conference hosted at the school. Shortly after this conference, faculty from the Art Department recognized the need to create a fine arts program at SJSU that would take advantage of the school's position in the heart of tech-heavy Silicon Valley. CADRE became a formal fine arts program at SJSU in 1985 and now offers B.F.A. and M.F.A. degrees. Students and faculty involved with CADRE have been at the forefront of new media and technology for over thirty years. The program is heavily focused on experimentation, exploring different facets of art and technology. Students in this unique program have the school's state-of-the-art facilities at their disposal, including fabrication and machine shops, computer labs, and studio space. <br /><br />
