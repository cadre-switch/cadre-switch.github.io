        Identifying art is one way to interpret its meaning and intentions, but what happens if Post-Internet art becomes too complex to understand when your viewer is somehow connected to an artist’s work. Is it possible to lose your artist’s touch or an accidental collaboration waiting to reform against traditional art?
Post-Internet engages the viewers participating and willing to become part of the art without being directly interesting in their work. Sure images and descriptions would suffice, but I want to dig deeper into the meaning.

<!-- I. Introduction -->
   <br />
The internet is another art medium that we don’t talk about enough, mainly because it is not the standardized traditional form of internet art, rather it is the viewers’ participation making it exist. Post-Internet engages the viewers’ participation and the ability to become part of the art without being directly interested in their work. I want to go over Post-Internet, “the art after the internet” as the rebel in the art realm, and how it is often mistaken as Net Art, “the original web 1.0”. Post-Internet art began in the 21st century (2000-2015) which has reflected the current internet trend. This is a visual style that directly represents the internet, rather than within the internet network. Post-Internet art creates a whole new aesthetic as we venture through the spread of digital technology because it opposes the ideas of the current internet. Since I mentioned my title as “My ID is Post-Internet”, I do not know the actual identity of this type of artwork. What criteria make it Post-Internet? Where does the word come from or how did it originate? What sets it apart from Net Art? How is it displayed in the gallery? Does it have to have internet elements as the materials? Was my identity borrowed to become good or bad? These questions will help me solve this theory or leave them unanswered. Therefore, I will go over the history of trends, the audience’s role behind the artwork, and their role in the art realm.

   <br /><br />
        
<!-- II. Body Paragraph 1 -->
<br /><br />

One of the characteristics of Post-Internet art is an Original-Copy Relationship. As HiSoUR stated in their article, “Post-internet redefines the original-copy relationship. It is primarily based on reworking what is available on the Internet.” (HiSoUR 2016). That is why I wanted to tackle the problem of whether this movement was intentionally created because of the indirect relationship with the viewers. This has created an online virality that causes a form of viewership and a mode of display. Another factor is the ability to be versatile when presenting the artwork. Post-Internet art can be displayed in online and offline medium formats. Online artworks are very common in Post-Internet because after all the internet comes from the computer. Surprisingly, offline art can be represented uniquely. An example of an offline medium artwork is the POST INTERNET SURVIVAL GUIDE created by Katja Novitskova who is an Estonian installation artist. Her installation showcases different objects that represent pieces of current internet trends which are about survival information and online routine in the present world. 
      

<br /><br />
        
<!-- III. Body Paragraph 2 -->
<br /><br />

 Post-Internet art was influenced by the Aesthetic Era due to the rise of Y2K and Vaporwave. Y2k stands for the Year of 2000, which is known as the Millennium bug. Y2K started as a fear in the late ’90s because people thought the global computer networks would collapse on January 1, 2000. Most of the color schemes would either be translucent, iridescent, or an array of bright colors. This is a representation of nostalgia as most Gen Z audiences seem to infiltrate this trend into fashion, media, music, etc…
This was also a nostalgic period because as we enter the future, the past was not explored enough to stay in the memory lane. According to Jane Morris, “It was also a time of a cultural shift in artistic practice when artists were using all sorts of new technologies.” (Morris 2018). Vaporwave is another trend that pulls us to the digital online art realm. Vaporwave is the 80’s digital art movement that revolves around nostalgic media formats, Japanese city pop, and surrealist entertainment. It “...reflects a mind made lazy, apathetic and detached by the existential anxiety the internet breeds” (Chakrabarti 2019). I thought this type of trend depicts Post-Internet art accurately because they share similar moods, colors, and modifications to the internet culture. After all, incorporating the past years not only enhances the art but reminds the viewers of mainstream trends that made a huge impact on the web. 
       
        
<br /><br />

<!-- IV. Body Paragraph 3 -->
<br /><br />

Many of these Post-Internet arts can be found on social media. The most common artworks would be found on Pinterest and Tumblr. These types of social media platforms do not normally upload by the artists themselves, rather it was being reuploaded or redirected by users who retrieved them from the source. If you type “Post-Internet art” into the search bar on either social media platform you’ll see all types of works that consist of physical aspects of the internet (window browser, cursor, laptop, etc…), people entering the web, or over-exaggerating mainstream or nostalgic trends. 
        
        
        
<br><br>
<!-- V. Body Paragraph 4 -->
<br /><br />

 I had no idea that there are Post-Internet Artists because I did not consider them professional artists. After looking at some of their artwork, it blew my mind! It was pretty difficult to find these artists because they were never mentioned in the books or by my professors. I chose three artists that I thought executed Post-Internet art in a stylistic manner which are Katja Novitskova, Cory Arcangel, and Molly Soda. As mentioned before, Katja Novitskova is an Estonian installation artist that focuses on issues of technology, evolutionary processes, digital imagery, and corporate aesthetics in her works. An example is her 2010  POST INTERNET SURVIVAL GUIDE where she created a survival guide book for navigating the internet and its evolution of attaining new information every second. Molly Soda is an internet performance artist and has worked in different mediums such as digital platforms, producing selfies videos, GIFs, zines, and web-based performance art. In the second image, Sorry if I’m getting too romantic, Molly Soda created a collage that consisted of roses that took up the whole space and became overbearing with affection. Since Valentine’s Day was known for romantic gestures and gifts, this artwork went beyond including so many gifts (roses) to show how much they love that person. Finally, Cory Arcangel is an American post-conceptual and installation artist who worked with different media platforms including music, video, performance art, and video game modifications. He uses huge led screens and displays them on the walls. On the screen would show the desktop screen, SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture & Television Engineers) color bars background with tech electronics, or hot media topics.        
        
        
<br /><br />
        
<!-- VI. Body Paragraph 5 -->
<br /><br />

 The audience accidentally collaborated with the artists because of their strong influence on how the artwork was made. According to Nina Blumberg, “Sean Fader, Pontes’s projects rely on viewer interaction and engagement for their success. However, the artist places a strong emphasis on studying the social and psychological motivations of her audience through her work.”(Blumberg 2015). The audience’s role in art is passive participation with the artist in making the art a success. Without any likes or engagement from the audience, then there is no reason for displaying art in the first place. The audience brings art attention, therefore visual representations of Post-Internet art would not exist without the viewership. Additionally, the artists acknowledge the audience’s past interest while offering content to their future audiences. This process is called Prosumption, “the act of consuming and producing at the same time.” (Troemel 2013). Prosumption focuses more on “found” than “created” art because it is easier to add more creativity to what has already been made. Sometimes, I wonder if post-internet was done as a parody or a rebellious statement about the internet. Authorship is a sensitive topic in the art realm especially if it is Post-Internet art. Blumberg stated that “Authorship, ownership, and copyright issues with art have been increasingly present in the news over the past decade as social media platforms have made image and information sharing widespread with the simple click of a button.” (Blumberg 2015). Tumblr, for example, has the image reblogging button feature that draws inspiration from the original Web content. This was the idea of borrowing the original content and modifying it from a different perspective just like how a meme was created from entertainment media.        
        

<br><br>  
        
<!-- VII. Body Paragraph 6 -->
<br /><br />

So what is Post-Internet identity and its role in the art realm? I assumed it has borrowed many identities from current trends and passed them off as its own. Once again Post-Internet art was created as “the art after the internet” which separates itself from Net Art. I admit that there may be some surrealism incorporated into the works because there are exaggerated parts of current trends used to reflect why it was created in the first place. The name of this medium raises the question because the word “Post” in Post-Internet means before, however, this medium started later than Net Art. According to Domenico Quaranta, “Artists started gathering in “surﬁng clubs,” group blogs where they collected, remixed, and shared the results of their daily surﬁng experience; instead of learning to hack and inventing their own language, they preferred to use commercials.” (Quaranta 2020). This has become a style that was imitated by later generations to make the art look visually appealing online. Therefore, to recognize Post-Internet art is to identify the oversimpliﬁcation of aesthetic and cultural trends.        
        
        
<br><br>
        
<!-- VIII. Conclusion -->
<br /> <br />
       
In conclusion, Post-Internet art is the rebel of internet art because it opposes the ideas of the current internet. This type of medium was heavily influenced by the 80s and 90s internet culture trends. When you see Post-Internet art, images from social media resurface and are reuploaded from their original source. The audience digitally and socially interacted in internet culture, therefore participating in helping the artist’s creative process. ​​Either way, Post-Internet art was a digital experience based on an accidental audience and reviving aesthetic nostalgia.
