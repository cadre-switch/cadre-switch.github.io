        Article Body
      </h2>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of creating a parallel world that replicates, extends, or enhances the current physical world has been a dream of many people. Starting in the 1990s, the dream slowly became reality, but one that was more virtual than real. Virtual Reality (VR) is the parallel world that exists in software programs and computer hardware. The Switch Journal interviewed leading thinkers of VR, Brenda Laurel and Linda Jacobson, to discuss and contextualize VR development and its implication for society and art. After thirty years, Virtual Reality has taken shape to form the foundation of the Metaverse, realizing concepts and ideas from the early days of VR but also introducing negative aspects that need to be addressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laurel and Jacobson are some of the early adopters and thinkers of VR who deliberated concepts that are still influential today. One core application of VR is to allow the user to experience the virtual world from different perspectives, ranging from animals to different people or different genders. The capability to experience different perspectives in VR may allow the mind to be disembodied from the physical body. However, Laurel appreciates the idea of having perspectives grounded in the physical body even with the advent of VR medium. Laurel states, &ldquo;Any medium that further weakens my sense of physical existence, right now, in real time, weakens my political power and political will to take care of myself&rdquo; (Challas). Laurel believes that separating the mind from the body weakens the self and reduces political power and political will. Rather than use VR as a tool for disembodiment, it may be used to facilitate interactions between users and the environment. Another core aspect of VR is to allow interactive creation within a new medium. Jacobson states, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to me that VR attain its lofty status as an artist&rsquo;s tool, an artistic medium, one that will allow the viewer or participant to become co-creator in the art. That alone affects our self-identity. With VR you&rsquo;re no longer just a consumer&rdquo; (Lange). Jacobson believes that the strength of VR is to give users agency and the power to make decisions and develop creative works, rather than just being a simple participant or consumer within a computer program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As computer hardware, software, and networks have grown more powerful, interconnected, and faster since the 1990s, the foundational concepts and applications of VR have evolved and coalesced into the Metaverse. Just what is the Metaverse? According to the New York Times, &ldquo;The metaverse is the convergence of two ideas that have been around for many years: virtual reality and a digital second life&rdquo; (Chen). Within the Metaverse, users are able to interact with friends, family, and strangers and live a parallel life using VR as the medium. In addition to VR, a growing infrastructure within the Metaverse is Web 3.0, which is the &ldquo;&hellip; idea of a new kind of internet service that is built using decentralized blockchains &ndash; the shared ledger systems used by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether&rdquo; (Roose). The main objective of Web3 is to rewire the Internet using blockchain technology to change the way information is stored, shared, and owned (Stackpole).&nbsp; New ways to manage information have opened up new opportunities. Digital art has expanded into the Metaverse, using Web3 blockchain technology to create digital deeds of digital objects or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are transferable, flowering a new art marketplace. It is this new Web3 infrastructure, human connectedness and interaction within the Metaverse that is opening new possibilities in art.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Metaverse acting as a new medium, art takes new directions that emphasizes connectedness and interactions between people and the environment. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dancing in the Metaverse</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a live performance that connects dancers wearing motion capture suits, with two from the United Kingdom portraying foxes and one from New York representing a nymph, and projects their dancing into a digital environment for an audience to experience and enjoy. Robert O&rsquo;Leary states in the Art Newspaper, &ldquo;We are immersed in a blended performance that explores the complex relationship between virtual and physical touch&rdquo; (What is). Dancers respond in real-time to one another&rsquo;s movement to interplay and interweave virtual and physical motions in a beautiful computer-generated landscape. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Substrata</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a VR landscape that is constructed to exhibit digital artworks from many artists. Users navigate through the digital environment to view and experience artworks. Dhiren Dasu states in the Art Newspaper, &ldquo;I felt that this space added value by taking the viewer into an environment that is otherwise not available to us in real life&rdquo; (Memories). It is the interaction with the virtual environment that enhances the experience of viewing artworks compared to real life galleries. While the Metaverse allows art to go in new directions, it also introduces concerns that need to be addressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics of the Metaverse and Web3 point out concerning issues of energy use and technology waste impacting the environment. It takes a lot of energy and many powerful computers to run a network like Bitcoin. The Harvard Business Review notes that &ldquo;&hellip; the annual e-waste created by Bitcoin is comparable to the amount produced by a country the size of the Netherlands&rdquo; (Stackpole). Furthermore, Columbia University reports that &ldquo;&hellip; bitcoin mining consumes 121.35 terawatt hours a year. This is more than all of Argentina consumes, or more than the consumption of Google, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft combined&rdquo; (Cho). E-waste and high energy consumption are the negative environmental impacts of running a virtual world that connects people from across the globe with one another. However, these issues are not being left alone. Newer blockchains are moving away from mining and using more efficient methods to reduce the consumption of electricity and environmental impact and addressing concerns by critics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are concerns about VR and the Metaverse, this virtual world holds great opportunity and promise for people and art. Interconnectedness within a virtual world has opportunities to transform the office work environment, where people can interact and collaborate creatively with one another in the comfort of their own homes. Art in the Metaverse promises new virtual experiences that allow people to immerse in new perspectives, participate in live performances, or engage in fantastical environments. These promises were once dreams held by Laurel and Jacobson. And these dreams are progressively becoming reality, in both the real world and the Metaverse.</span></p>
