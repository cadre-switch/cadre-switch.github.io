<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<h4><span>Thesis:</span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Fourth Wave Feminism has a significant impact on contemporary media and culture due to ideals and goals demonstrated by the Fourth Wave.</span></h4>
<h4><span>Introduce your insight on each topic. Okay, that's cool. But why does that matter? What do you plan to do to prove this?</span></h4>
<h4><span>The goal of this article is to demonstrate the impact of Fourth Wave Feminism on culture and media</span></h4>
<h3><strong>Social Media</strong></h3>
<h4><span>Me Too Movement</span></h4>
<p><span>P: Intro to the MeToo movement</span></p>
<p><span>I: Inform the reader about the movement. What is the movement about? How did it start? Etc.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>E: Explain why it matters? How does it relate to feminism? Impact on feminism?&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Depp vs Heard influence</span></h4>
<p><span>How was the Depp case influenced by social media? The MeToo movement gave voices to not just only females, but males too. It helped Depp publicly voice his abuse of Heard on social media and possibly saved his life.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Inform what happened with this scenario. What is the current result of the case?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This matters because feminism (despite the name) and the MeToo movement gave voices to not just females, but males too. The Depp case is a great example of how powerful feminism is in culture.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Scientific Facts about Social Media and Feminism</span></h4>
<p><span>Topic: Social Media is mostly used by females, with the demographic only rising due to the effects of the MeToo movement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Inform: Throw them statistics (</span><a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/how-social-media-has-reshaped-feminism"><span>https://www.cfr.org/blog/how-social-media-has-reshaped-feminism</span></a><span>)</span></p>
<p><span>This matters because it shows the impact and importance of social media being an incredibly powerful tool for females. It allowed females to express themselves in many forms and expressions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Art/Design</strong></h3>
<h4><span>Pussyhat Project</span></h4>
<p><span>What is the Pussyhat Project?</span></p>
<p><span>How did it start? What is the current status of this project? What was the goal?</span></p>
<p><span>This project was important to feminism because _.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Cassie McQuarter - Black Room (</span><a href="http://www.cassiemcquater.com/blackroom.html"><span>link</span></a><span>)</span></h4>
<p><span>What is this game about?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What is the meaning behind the game? What are some of the example sprites and assets used here?</span></p>
<p><span>This game is important to feminism because it showcases feminism in video games. Not every girl is just big-booby sexy ladies, they are badass warriors and more too. In other words, this project is important because it shows people (men at least) that girls in video games are more than just sex appeal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Kumikaho Oshima - Barbies (</span><a href="https://www.creativeboom.com/inspiration/kumikaho-oshimas-paintings-of-barbie-dolls-highlight-the-revolution-of-japanese-women/"><span>link</span></a><span>)</span></h4>
<p><span>What is this artwork about?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What is the messaging behind it? What medium did she use? Why barbie dolls? Why the sexual positions?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So how does it relate to feminism? This is in the messaging of the painting where it depicts women used as just &ldquo;dolls&rdquo; for various reasons. Specifically, some of them have money which has a variety of meanings. One of them is showing the desire for money equalling power.&nbsp; These Barbie dolls are meant to resemble the desires and morals of women.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Music</strong></h3>
<h4><span>Lana Del Rey</span></h4>
<p><span>Who is Lana Del Rey?</span></p>
<p><span>How does she relate to feminism in her music? What are some example lyrics or songs? Social Media influencer&hellip;</span></p>
<p><span>This is important because she is one of the many examples of celebrities who represent feminism. You don&rsquo;t see a lot of that today with other musicians.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Beyonce</span></h4>
<p><span>Who is Beyonce?</span></p>
<p><span>Song: Flawless and lyrics. Meanings behind it? Single Ladies music video?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Beyonce is one of the most popular celebrities demonstrating feminism through her work. She does this by using feministic themes and tones in her music and videos.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Films/TV Shows</strong></h3>
<h4><span>Diablo Cody Films (Juno, Jennifer&rsquo;s Body, and more)</span></h4>
<p><span>Who is Diablo Cody?</span></p>
<p><span>Explain the impact of Juno and its eventual themes of feminism in other movies in a nutshell.</span></p>
<p><span>Juno (the leading example of this paragraph) is important because it demonstrates the struggles of pregnancy in women and the effects of unwanted pregnancies. Its relation to Feminism is demonstrating these struggles with being a female, which eventually becomes a reoccurring theme in all of Cody&rsquo;s movies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Orange Is The New Black</span></h4>
<p><span>What is this show about?</span></p>
<p><span>The show's cast is entirely female with racial diversity. It was a show that was targeted toward the female demographic and made transgender actress Laverne Cox a mega-star. This is the first example of an LGBTQ star becoming a mega-star in feminism.</span></p>
<p><span>This matters because it shows examples of LGBTQ stars having a rise in today's modern culture. Not to mention that the show was a huge success which debunks the myth of female-centric shows not being worthy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Bridesmaids</span></h4>
<p><span>What is this movie about?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Inform more about the messaging about the film</span></p>
<p><span>This relates to feminism both in its messaging and outside the film. It demonstrates that films created by women for women can make tons of money. (myth: &ldquo;chick flicks can never make any huge amount of profit&rdquo;)</span></p>
<h3><strong>Literature</strong></h3>
<h4><span>Roxane Gay&rsquo;s essay collection (Bad Feminist)</span></h4>
<p><span>What is the essay collection series about?</span></p>
<p><span>Inform: it shows examples of contemp. Feminism in culture and expands upon it. Specifically, it shows her personal experiences with feminism in culture and expresses her love and hate for feminism.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is important because it shows examples of a female who expresses her unbiased views on feminism in society and culture through her own experiences.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<h4><span>Summarize main points</span></h4>
<h4><span>CCTA or something&hellip;</span></h4>
