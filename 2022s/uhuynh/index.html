<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intro:</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artists worldwide are fascinated by cooperative or collective techniques of artistic production that combine art, social engagement, and community development. Collaborative art experiences in which the community develops, sometimes in collaboration with an artist, and then helps spread the art endeavor are known as collaborative art creation. Collaborative community art, like social sculpture, shapes a community's visual aesthetic while also strengthening communal bonds. Arts organizations are attempting to provide access to art-making activities in various settings, ranging from parks to libraries. In recent years, collaborative arts have been developing in digital media. This paper will introduce a unique communication-making art cooperation in digital media and social interactions by studying digital art content created from sharing and collaboration through a subreddit called r/place.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Body:</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">r/place was a collaborative initiative and social experiment that first started on April Fools' Day 2017 and rebooted April Fools' Day 2022 on the social networking site Reddit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Josh Wardle came up with the experiment's concept first in 2017. Wardle's experiment involved an online canvas hosted on the r/place subreddit, which registered users may update by replacing a single pixel's color with a replacement from a 16-color palette. Individually registered users could place one single colored pixel (or "tile") on an online canvas of one million (1000 &times; 1000) pixel squares and wait a set amount of time before placing another. A timer would stop the user from inserting any more pixels for a period ranging from 5 to 20 minutes after placing each pixel. On April 3, 2017, Reddit admins ended the experiment after 72 hours. Over 1 million active users modified the canvas, putting a total of approximately 16 million pixels, and over 90,000 users were actively watching or altering the canvas when the experiment concluded. People united, formed alliances, and waged conflicts to defend their lands. People all over the world used subreddits and private Discord chats for discussion. The final product was nothing short of a masterpiece! Reproductions of well-known artworks such as the Mona Lisa and A Starry Night were created. Pop culture references were also scattered over the artwork by fandoms. The project was praised for accurately portraying the culture of Reddit's online communities and Internet culture in general. Reddit restarted the experiment on April 1, 2022, and it lasted four days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After five years, the team agreed to develop again in 2022 on April Fool's Day. The project became even more prominent this year, with nearly four times the number of dots placed than the previous year. The event's primary goal was to bring together a variety of art genres and internet subcultures on one canvas for a pleasant experience. Communities were able to create works of art by cooperating in the middle of chaos. However, regular monitoring and dedication are required to conserve these works of art. Even if you place artwork, it would be gone even in a few minutes if you couldn't defend it. By the end of the event, almost 6 million users placed roughly 72 million dots on the canvas, averaging more than 2.5 million dots each hour.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's impossible to build alone because each user can only place a single, tiny tile every five minutes. The five-minute wait time throttles any single person's ability to dominate the canvas. Users instead need to work concurrently and produce harmonized communities to create collective works of pixel art.</span></p>
