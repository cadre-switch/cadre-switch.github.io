        Article Body
      </h2>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the modern world, where everything is moving at a fast pace, to get the information across the majority of people or reshape public awareness, magazines, advertisements, newspapers, books, social media, and webs require photos to go along as a visual attention element. Thus, acting as an attention-getter, photos are mostly edited, retouched, or in general, manipulated. Images were done so to easily promote the idea or quickly convey the message rather than solely relying on the text itself. Tracing back to the Switch article, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metamorphoses Digital Photography in the Electronic Age and Pixel Perfect: Digital Photography in the Bay Area </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(1998), which talked about the arisen digital photography contains photo manipulation processes in the two exhibitions at the San Jose Museum of Modern Art. (1) The artworks stirred up controversies over whether digitally manipulated photographs are forms of art because their origins were altered. Despite being a controversial topic up until now due to its deceiving aspect, photo manipulation still holds an essential role in the modern digital world.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what exactly is photo manipulation? And how is it done? As the name suggests, it is a process of modifying the original image. In more detail, as Kelsie Rimmer mentioned in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Art Trend: Photo Manipulation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, &ldquo;...photo manipulation often involves blending photos, graphics and other visual elements together to create bizarre, out-of-this world artworks and effects.&rdquo; (2) It includes a wide range of changes from minor scope with photo editing such as color or exposure adjustments with tone curves and color balance. Or, to a major scale like photo bashing technique that adds, replaces, and blends multiple photos, may contain double or multiple exposure, into one final work just as Aron Visuals shows in his work, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undiscovered Land</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (3) Regardless of the wonderful outcomes, many people still refer to photo manipulation as photo &lsquo;tampering&rsquo; rather than an artist's production because of countless misuse cases to deceive others.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything has its advantages and drawbacks, so as photo manipulation. Nowadays, the advancement in social media has changed the way people perceive information. It also gives rise to more phishing schemes, and false propaganda acts through photo manipulation to gain sales or believers. Moreover, some research even shows that it puts a toll on people&rsquo;s mental health and self-esteem with the birth of beautify apps. Hence, stir the controversy around manipulated images and their legitimacy, as well as being altered to what extent for it to be considered appropriate. For example, the FaceApp application.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FaceApp is a face-altering photo app developed by a Russian company, and released worldwide in 2017. It uses advanced artificial intelligence (AI) to apply filters over the user&rsquo;s face; some of its well-known features is the aging ability to make users appear younger or older than their actual look. However, upon releasing, FaceApp encountered racial statements with the trending filter that promise to make users look &lsquo;hotter&rsquo;. Apparently, what it did was only &lsquo;whitening&rsquo; people&rsquo;s skin tone and trying to turn them into white. This seemingly wants to imply that white skin tone is the standard of beauty for all human races, and any skin tone that is not white is considered as not beautiful. (4) Moreover, there is a larger potential threat for all of its users - privacy violation. The terms and services of FaceApp clearly states that &ldquo;You grant FaceApp a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully-paid, transferable sub-licensable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works...without compensation to you.&rdquo; (5) It means that all of the users&rsquo; photos will be stored on the cloud indefinitely, and reused as much as the developers want. This is even more dangerous than before with the advanced AI technology. Like deepfake, for instance, a technology that can completely alter the face of a person, which then can be used for false purposes in politics, advertisements, or even pornographic. Lastly, FaceApp is also seen as one of the pioneer applications to redefine the new beauty standards.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the explosion of social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, or Tiktok, photo manipulation has severely distorted reality. All of the applications mentioned above have one thing in common - a built-in beauty filter. Just like FaceApp, these filters also modify the user body&rsquo;s features like v-line face shape, smooth skin, double eyelids, bump-up lips, thin nose, small waist, and so on and so forth. Little by little, the images with filtered-on posts posted in social media have become a new unrealistic beauty standard among generations and everyone goes crazy over it, especially young people. These beauty filters are changing the way they see themselves and gradually affecting their mental health. (6) It makes them unconsciously constantly criticize their body, thus lowering their self-image and self-esteem. Moreover, social media has helped a vast amount of people to become famous easily with just a few photos of them using filters. This creates a trending wave of obsession with unrealistic beauty standards because the more beautiful you appear in social media, the more followers you acquire.</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite it being a controversial topic, photo manipulation still holds an essential role in the modern digital world by helping artists to create more appealing visual images that can spark inspiration. It allows artists to express themselves freely or push the context to another extreme level about philosophy, environment, and world crisis. Remarkably, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infilteriterations</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Huntrezz Janos, a Los Angeles Afrohungarian artist, tackles and reverses the deceitful feature of photo manipulation. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infilteriterations</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an online exhibition utilizing the augmented reality face filter that allows users to express their virtual identity and their artistic style during the chaotic time of the COVID-19 pandemic. (7) Or artists like Rosa Menkman with 365 Perfect Decalibration series to address, as she explained, &ldquo;not only a powerful commentary on the relationship between mobile technology and the beauty industry, but a careful exploration of generation loss.&rdquo; (8)&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, it also helps aid concept artists in their workflow to achieve the desired result in a short amount of time. In the film and video games industry,&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
